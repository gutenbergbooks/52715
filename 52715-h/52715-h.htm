<p class='pindent'>There was a ripple of chimes through the frosty air
as Catherine Murchison turned from King’s Walk
into Lombard Street, and saw the moon shining white and
clear between the black parapets and chimney-stacks of the
old houses. St. Antonia’s steeple was giving the hour of
three, and a babel of lesser tongues answered from the
silence of the sleeping town. Hoar-frost glittered on the
cypresses that stood in a garden bounding the road, and
the roofs were like silver under the hard, moonlit sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine Murchison stopped before the great red-brick
house with its white window-sashes, and its Georgian air
of solidity and comfort. The brass lion’s-head on the door
seemed to twinkle a welcome to her above the plate that
carried her husband’s name. She smiled to herself as she
drew the latch-key from the pocket under her sables, the
happy smile of a woman who comes home with no searchings
of the heart. Several shawl-clad figures went gliding
along under the shadows of the cypresses, giving her good-night
with a flutter of laughter and tapping of shoes along
the stones. Catherine waved her hand to the beshawled
ones as they scurried home, and caught a glimpse of St.
Antonia’s spire diademed by the winter stars. She remembered
such a night seven years ago, and man’s love
and mother’s love had come to her since then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine closed the door gently, knowing that her husband
would be asleep after a hard day’s work. It was not
often that he went with her to the social gatherings of
Roxton. Professional success, fraught with the increasing
responsibilities thereof, brightened his own fireside for
him, and Catherine his wife would rather have had it so.
James Murchison was no dapper drawing-room physician.
The man loved his home better than the dinner-tables of
his patients. He was young, and he was ambitious with
his grave and purposeful Saxon sanity. His wife took the
social yoke from off his shoulders, content in her heart to
know that she had made the man’s home dear to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A standard-lamp was burning in the hall, the light
streaming under a red-silk shade upon the Oriental rugs
covering the mellow and much polished parquetry. There
were a few old pictures on the walls, pewter and brass lighting
the dead oak of an antique dresser. Catherine Murchison
looked round her with a breathing in of deep content.
She unwrapped the shawl from about her hair, rich russet
red hair that waved in an aureole about her face. Her
sable cloak had swung back from her bosom, showing the
black ball-dress, red over the heart with a knot of hothouse
flowers. There was a wholesome and generous purity in
the white curves of her throat and shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine laid her cloak over an old Dutch chair, and
turned to the table where fruits, biscuits, and candles had
been left for her. Her husband’s gloves lay on the table,
and his hat with one of Gwen’s dolls tucked up carefully
herein. Catherine’s eyes seemed to mingle thoughts of
child and man, as she ate a few biscuits and looked at Miss
Gwen’s protégé stuffed into the hat. James Murchison
had had a long round that day, with the cares and conflicts
of a man who labors to satisfy his own conscience. Catherine
hoped not to wake him; she had even refused to be
driven home lest the sound of wheels should carry a too
familiar warning to his ears. She lit her candle, and,
reaching up, turned out the lamp. Her feet were on the
first step of the stairs when a streak of light in the half-darkness
of the hall brought her to a halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one had left the lamp burning in her husband’s
study. She stepped back across the hall, and hesitated a
moment as other thoughts occurred to her. Housebreaking
was a dead art in Roxton, and she smiled at the melodramatic
imaginings that had seized her for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A reading-lamp stood on the table before the fire, that
had sunk to a dull and dirty red in the smokeless grate.
The walls of the room were panelled with books and the
glass faces of several instrument cabinets—the room of no
mere specialist, no haunter of one alley in the metropolis
of intelligence. On the sofa lay the figure of a man
asleep, his deep breathing audible through the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the wife there was nothing strange in finding her
husband sleeping the sleep of the tired worker before the
dying fire. Her eyes had a laughing tenderness in them,
a sparkle of mischief, as she set down the candle and
moved across the room. Her feet touched something that
rolled under her dress. She stooped, and looked innocent
enough as she picked up an empty glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was mirth in the voice, but her eyes showed a
puzzled intentness as she noticed the things that stood
beside the lamp upon the table. An open cigar-box, a
tray full of crumbled ash and blackened matches, a couple
of empty syphons, a decanter standing in an ooze of spilled
spirit. Memory prompted her, and she smiled at the suggestion.
Porteus Carmagee, that prattling, white-bobbed
maker of wills and codicils had slipped in for a smoke and
a gossip. James Murchison never touched alcohol, and
the inference was obvious enough, for her experience of
Mr. Carmagee’s loquacity justified her in concluding that
he had droned her husband to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wifely mischief was in the ascendant on the instant.
She stooped over the sleeping man whose face was in the
shadow, put her lips close to his, and drew back with a
little catching of the breath. The room seemed to grow
dark and very cold of a sudden. She straightened, and
stood rigid, staring across the room with a sense of hurrying
at the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as though compelling herself, she lifted the lamp,
and held it so that the light fell full upon her husband’s
face.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Man is the heir of many ancestors, and his inheritance
of life’s estate may prove cumbered by mortgages
unredeemed by earlier generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of the year the blood is hot, and the quicksilver
of youth burns in the brain. The poise of true manhood
is not reached at twenty, the experience to know, the
strength to grapple. James Murchison of the broad back
and sunny face, first of good fellows, popular among all,
had followed the joy of being and feeling even into shady
back-street rooms. In the hospital “common-room” he
had always had a knot of youngsters round him, lounging,
smoking, lads with no studied vice in them, but lads to
whom life was a thing of zest. For Murchison it had been
the crest of the wave, the day of the world’s youth. An
orphan with money at his bank, the liberty of London
calling him, a dozen mad youngsters to form a coterie!
As for heredity and such doctrines of man’s ascent and
fall, he had not studied them in the thing he called himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison had carved up corpses, electrified
frogs, and learned the art of dispensing physic before the
world taught him to discover that there were other things
to conquer besides text-books and examiners. His father
had died of drink, and his grandfather before him, and
God knows how many fat Georgian kinsmen had contributed
to the figures on the debit side. From his mother he
had inherited wholesome yeoman blood, and the dower
perhaps had made him what he was, straight-backed,
clean-limbed, strong in the jaw, brave and blue about the
eyes. There had been no blot on him till he had gone up
to London as a lonely boy. There in the solitude the
world had caught him, and tossed him out of his dingy
rooms to taste the wine of the world’s pleasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The phase was natural enough, and there had been
plenty of young fools to applaud it in him. The first slip
had come after a hospital concert; the second after a football
match; the third had followed a successful interview
with the Rhadamanthi who passed candidates in the duties
of midwifery. An ejectment from a music-hall, a brawl
in Oxford Street, a <span class='it'>liaison</span> with a demi-mondaine, complaints
from landladies, all these had reached the ears of
the Dean’s “great ones” who sat in conclave. Murchison
had been argued with in private by a gray-haired surgeon
who had that strong grip on life that goes with virility and
the noble sincerity of faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fight yourself, sir,” the old man had said; “fight as
though the devil had you by the throat. If you bring
children into the world you will set a curse on them unless
you break your chains.” And Murchison had gone out
from him with a set jaw and an awakened manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for the first time in life he learned the value of a
friend. The man was dead now; he had died in Africa,
dragged down by typhoid in some sweltering Dutch town.
James Murchison remembered him always with a warming
of the heart. He remembered how they had gone
together to a little Sussex village by the sea, taken a coast-guard’s
disused cottage for eighteen pence a week, bathed,
fished, cooked their own food, and pitched stones along
the sand. James Murchison had fought himself those
summer weeks, growing brown-faced as a gypsy between
sun and sea. He had taken the wholesome strength of it
into his soul, passed through the furnace of his last two
years unscathed, and set out on life, a man with a keen
mouth, clean thoughts, and six feet of Saxon strength.
The world respected him, never so much as dreaming that
he had the devil of heredity tight bound within his heart.</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, are you better now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had told her everything, sitting in the dusk before
the fire, one fist under his chin, and his eyes the eyes of a
strong man enduring bitter shame. Woman’s love had
watched over him that day. She had striven to lift him up
out of the dust of his deep remorse, and had opened her
whole heart to him, showing the quiet greatness of her
nature in her tenderness towards this strong man in his
sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate, how can you bear this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bear it, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finding so much of the beast in me. My God, I
thought the thing was dead; we are never dead, dear, to
our father’s sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came and sat beside him before the fire, a man’s
woman, pure, generous, trusty to the deeps. The light
made magic in her hair, and showed the unfathomable
faith within her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put the memory behind you,” she said, looking up into
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groaned, as though dust and ashes still covered his
manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too good to me, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and she drew his hands down into her bosom;
the warmth thereof seemed to comfort him as a mother’s
breast comforts a child at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you have told me—all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It helps me, it will help us both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to have told you long ago,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that I had killed the thing, and I loved you,
dear, and perhaps I was a coward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew closer to him, leaning against his knee, while
one of his strong arms went about her body. The warm
darkness of the room seemed full of the sacred peace of
home. They were both silent, silent for many minutes
till the sound of children’s laughter came down from the
rooms above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison bent forward, and drew a deep breath
as though in pain. The flash of sympathy was instant in
its passage. Husband and wife were thinking the same
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate, you must help me to fight this down—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For their sakes, the children—for yours. I think that
I have worked too hard of late. When the strength’s out
of one, the devil comes in and takes command. And the
servants, you are sure—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt the spasmodic girding of all his manhood, and
yearned to him with all her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They knew nothing; I saved that. Don’t let us talk
of it; the thing is over”—and she tried not to shudder.
“Ah—I am glad I know, dear, I can do so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison bent down and drew her into his arms,
and she lay there awhile, feeling that the warmth of her love
passed into her husband’s body. The hearth was red
before them with the fire-light, and they heard the sound
of their children playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go up to them?” she said, at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes”—and she knew by his face that he was praying,
not with mere words, but with every life-throb of his being—“it
will do me good. God bless you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they kissed each other.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty Steel sat alone at the breakfast-table
with a silver teapot covered with a crimson
cosy before her, and a pile of letters and newspapers at
her elbow. The west front of St. Antonia’s showed
through the window, buttress and pinnacle glimmering
up into the morning sunlight. Frost-rimed trees spun a
scintillant net against the blue. The quiet life of the old
town went up with its lazy plumes of smoke into the crisp
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty Steel drew a slice of toast from the rack,
toyed with it, and looked reflectively at her husband’s
empty chair. She was a dark, sinuous, feline creature
was Mrs. Betty, with a tight red mouth, and an olive
whiteness of skin under her black wreath of hair. Her
hands were thin, mercurial, and yet suggestive of pretty
and graceful claws. A clever woman, cleverer with her
head than with her heart, acute, elegant, aggressive, yet
often circuitous in her methods. She had abundant impulse
in her, blood, and clan, even evidenced by the way
in which she ripped the wrapper from a copy of the
<span class='it'>Wilmenden Mail</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty buried her face in the pages, crumbling her
toast irritably as her eyes ran to and fro over the head-lines.
She glanced up as her husband entered, a smooth-faced,
compressed, and professional person, with an assured
manner and an incisive cut of the mouth and chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any news in this hub of monotony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife put down the paper, and called back the dog
who was poking his nose near the bacon-dish on the fire-guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quack medicines much in evidence. The fellows are
arrant Papists, Parker; they promise to cure everything
with nothing. Tea or coffee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty spoke with the slight drawl that was habitual
to her. Her admirers felt it to be distinguished, but its
effect upon shop assistants was to spread the instincts of
socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Parker Steel declared for coffee, and took salt to
his porridge. He was not a man who wasted words, save
perhaps on the most paying patients. Professional ambition,
and an aggressive conviction that he was to be the
leading citizen in Roxton filled the greater part of the
gentleman’s sphere of consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And local sensations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Pindar’s ball, a very dull affair, sausage-rolls
and jelly, and a floor like glue—probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lombard Street clique, the Carnabys, Tom
Flemming, Kate Murchison, etc., etc., etc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel grunted, and appeared to be estimating
the number of cubes in the sugar bowl by way of exercising
himself in the compilation of statistics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison not there, I suppose?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wife—quite sufficient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband smiled, showing the regular white teeth
under his trim, black mustache with scarcely any flow of
feeling in his features. Dr. Parker Steel was very proud
of his teeth and finger-nails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t love that lady much, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s refined superciliousness trifled with the
suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate Murchison? I cannot say that I ever trouble
much about her. Rather fat and vulgar—perhaps. Fat
women do not appeal to me; they seem to carry sentimentality
and gush about with them like patchouli. Do
you think that you are gaining ground on Murchison,
Parker, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The husband appeared confident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Hicks will resign the Hospital soon; you must
take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not worth the trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s dark eyes condemned the assertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dirt’s money in the wrong place, as they say in trade,
Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” And the amused consort glanced at her with
a cold flicker of affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Study it on utilitarian principles. Lady Twaddle-twaddle
sends her cook, or her gardener, or her boot-boy
to be treated in Roxton Hospital. You exercise yourself
on the boot-boy or the cook, and Lady Twaddle-twaddle
approves the cure. Praise is never thrown away.
Let the old ladies who attend missionary meetings say of
you, ‘that Dr. Steel is so kind and attentive to the poor.’
We have to lay the foundation of a palace in the soil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel chuckled, knowing that behind Mrs.
Betty’s elegant verbiage there was a tenacity of purpose
that would have surprised her best friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder whether Murchison is as privileged as I
am?” he said, passing his cup over the red tea cosy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose the woman gushes for him, just as I work
my wits for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Amazons of Roxton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We live in a civilized age, Parker, but the battle is no
less bitter for us. I use my head. Half the words I
speak are winged for a final end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are clever enough, Betty,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We both have brains”—and she gave an ironical
laugh—“I shall not be content till the world, our world,
fully recognizes that fact. Old Hicks is past his work.
Murchison is the only rival you need consider. Therefore,
Parker, our battle is with the gentleman of Lombard
Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with the wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is my affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such life feuds as are chronicled in the hatred of a
Fredegonde for a Brunehaut may be studied in miniature
in many a modern setting. Ever since childhood Betty
Steel and Catherine Murchison had been born foes. Their
innate instincts had seemed antagonistic and repellent, and
the life of Roxton had not chastened the tacit feud. Girls
together at the same school, they had fought for leadership
and moral sway. Catherine had been one of those
creatures in whom the deeper feelings of womanhood
come early to the surface. Children had loved her; her
arms had been always open to them, and she had stood
out as a species of little mother to whom the owners of
bleeding knees had run for comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rivalry of girlhood had deepened into the rivalry
of womanhood. They were the “beauties” of Roxton;
the one generous, ruddy, and open-hearted; the other sleek,
white-faced, a studied artist in elegance and charm. Both
were admired and championed by their retainers; Catherine
popular with the many, Betty served by the few.
Miss Elizabeth had beheld herself the less favored goddess,
and as of old the apple of Paris had had the power to
inflame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s final crime against her rival had been her
marrying of James Murchison. Miss Betty had chosen the
gentleman for herself, though she would rather have bitten
her tongue off than have confessed the fact. The hatred
of the wife had been extended to the husband, and Dr.
Parker Steel had assuaged the smart. And thus the
rivalry of these two women lived on intensified by the professional
rivalry of two men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for my lady Betty, she hated the wife in Lombard
Street with all the quiet virulence of her nature. It was
the hate of the head for the heart, of the intellect for the
soul. Envy and jealousy were sponsors to the bantling
that Betty Steel had reared. Catherine Murchison had
children; Mrs. Steel had none. Her detestation of her
rival was the more intense even because she recognized
the good in her that made her loved by others. Catherine
Murchison had a larger following than Mrs. Steel
in Roxton, and the truth strengthened the poison in the
stew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Catherine the feeling was more one of distaste
than active enmity. Betty Steel repelled her, even as
certain electrical currents repel the magnet. She mistrusted
the woman, avoided her, even ignored her, an
attitude which did not fail to influence Mrs. Betty. Catherine
Murchison’s heart was too full of the deeper happiness
of life for her to trouble her head greatly about the
pale and fastidious Greek whose dark eyes flashed whenever
she passed the great red brick house in Lombard
Street. Life had a June warmth for Catherine. Nor
had she that innate restlessness of soul that fosters jealousy
and the passion for climbing above the common
crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel reminded his wife, as he rose from the
breakfast-table, of a certain charity concert that was to
be given at the Roxton public hall the same evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I believe so; Mrs. Fraser extorted a guinea from
us; I may as well get something for my money. And
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband smoothed his hair and looked in the
mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expecting a confinement. If you get a chance, be
polite to old Fraser, she would be worth bagging in the
future, and Murchison thieved her from old Hicks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine Murchison sang at the charity concert that
night, and Mrs. Betty listened to her with the outward
complacency of an angel. The big woman in her black
dress, with a white rose in her ruddy hair, bowed and
smiled to the enthusiasts of the Roxton slums who knew
her nearly as well as they knew her husband. Catherine
Murchison’s rare contralto flowed unconcernedly over her
rival’s head. She sang finely, and without effort, and the
voice seemed part of her, a touch of the sunset, a breath
from the fields of June. Catherine’s nature came out before
men in her singing. A glorious unaffectedness, a
charm with no trick of the self-conscious egoist. It was
this very naturalness, this splendid unconcern that had
forever baffled Mrs. Betty Steel. The woman was proof
against the mundane sneer. Ridicule could not touch
her, and the burrs of spite fell away from her smooth
completeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, what a voice that woman has!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bourgeoisie of Roxton was piling up its applause.
Mrs. Murchison had half the small boys in the town as
her devoted henchmen. Politically her personality would
have carried an election.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes from the heart, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteous Carmagee, solicitor and commissioner for
oaths, had his bald head tilted towards Mr. Thomas
Flemming’s ear. Mr. Flemming was one of the cultured
idlers of the town, a gentleman who was an authority on
ornithology, who presided often at the county bench, and
could dash off a cartoon that was not quite clever enough
for <span class='it'>Punch</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say, Carmagee? The beggars are
making such a din—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the heart, sir, from the heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indigestion, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carmagee was seized with an irritable twitching of
his creased, brown face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, an encore, that’s good. I said, Tom, that Kate
Murchison’s voice came from her heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely, very likely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could sit all night and hear her sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt it,” quoth the man of culture, with a twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opening notes rippled on the piano, and Mr. Carmagee
lay back in his chair to listen. He was a little
monkey of a man, fiery-eyed, wrinkled, with a grieved
and husky voice that seemed eternally in a hurry. He
knew everybody and everybody’s business, and the secrets
his bald pate covered would have trebled the circulation
of the <span class='it'>Roxton Herald</span> in a week. Porteous Carmagee was
godfather to Catherine Murchison’s two children. She
was one of the few women, and he had stated it almost
as a grievance, who could make him admit the possible
advantages of matrimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo, bravo”—and Mr. Carmagee slapped Tom
Flemming’s knee. ‘When the swans fly towards the
south, and the hills are all aglow.’ I believe in woman
bringing luck, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, possibly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison took the right turning. Supposing he had
married—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flemming trod on the attorney’s toe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out, she’s there; people have ears, you know;
they’re not chairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carmagee nursed a grievance on the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mention a name,” he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Thomas Flemming pointed towards Mrs. Betty
with his programme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s wife drove home alone in her husband’s
brougham, ignoring the many moonlight effects that the
old town offered her with its multitudinous gables and
timbered fronts. She was not in the happiest of tempers,
feeling much like a sensuous cat that has been tumbled
unceremoniously from some crusty stranger’s lap.
Betty had attempted blandishments with the distinguished
Mrs. Fraser, and had been favored with a shoulder and
half an aristocratic cheek. Moreover, she had watched
the great lady melt under Catherine Murchison’s smiles,
and such incidents are not rose leaves to a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty lay back in a corner of the brougham, and
indulged herself in mental tearings of Catherine Murchison’s
hair. What insolent naturalness this rival of
hers possessed! Mrs. Betty was fastidious and critical
enough, and her very acuteness compelled her to confess
that her enmity seemed but a blunted weapon. Catherine
Murchison was so cantankerously popular. She
looked well, dressed well, did things well, loved well.
The woman was an irritating prodigy. It was her very
sincerity, the wholesomeness of her charm, that made
her seem invulnerable, a woman who never worried her
head about social competition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel sat reading before the fire when his wife
returned. He uncurled himself languidly and with deliberation,
pulled down his dress waistcoat, and put his
book aside carefully on the table beside his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enjoyed yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not vastly. I wonder why vulgar people always eat
oranges in public?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than sucking lemons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty tossed her opera-cloak aside and slipped into
a chair. Her husband’s complacency irritated her a little.
He was not a sympathetic soul, save in the presence of
prominent patients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look bored, dear. Who performed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The usual amateurs. I am tired to death; are you
coming to bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel looked at the clock, and sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not be wanted till about five,” he said. “Confound
these guinea babies. I hope to build a tariff wall
round myself when we are more independent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mrs. Fraser?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe in the other camp, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel was dropping off to sleep that night when
he felt his wife’s hand upon his shoulder. He turned
with a grunt, and saw her white face dim amid her cloud
of hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Do you believe in Murchison, Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe in him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, is he reliable; does he know his work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, do you want to consult the fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have never caught him tripping?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. What are you driving at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—nothing,” and she turned away, and put the hair
back from her face, feeling feverish with the ferment of
her thoughts.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>No one in Roxton would have imagined that any
shadow of dread darkened the windows of the house
in Lombard Street. Even to his most intimate friends,
James Murchison would have appeared as the one man
least likely to be dominated by any inherited taint of
body or mind. His face was the face of a man who had
mastered his own passions, the mouth firm yet generous,
the jaw powerful, the eyes and forehead suggesting the
philosopher behind the virility of the man of action. He
had built up a substantial reputation for himself in Roxton
and the neighborhood. His professional honesty was
unimpeachable, his skill as a surgeon a matter of common
gossip. But it was his warm-heartedness, the sincerity
of his sympathy, his wholesome Saxon manliness
that had won him popularity, especially among the poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Catherine the uncovering of the past had come as
a second awakening, a resanctification of her love. Women
are the born champions of hero worship, and to generous
natures imperfections are but as flints scattered in
the warm earth of life. Women will gather them and
hide them in their bosoms, breathing a more passionate
tenderness perhaps, and betraying nothing to the outer
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison and his wife had held each other’s
hands more firmly, like those who approach a narrow
mountain path. They were happy in their home life,
happy with each other, and with their children. To the
woman’s share there was added a new sacredness that
woke and grew with every dawn. There were wounds
to be healed, bitternesses to be warded off. The man
who lay in her arms at night needed her more dearly,
and there was exultation in the thought for her. She
loved him the more for this stern thorn in the flesh. The
pity of it seemed to make him more her own, to knit her
tenderness more bravely round him, to fill life with a
more sacred fire. She was not afraid of the future for his
sake, believing him too strong to be vanquished by an
ancestral sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one day in April when James Murchison came
rattling over the Roxton cobbles in his motor-car, to slacken
speed suddenly in Chapel Gate at the sight of a red
Dutch bonnet, a green frock, and a pair of white-socked
legs on the edge of the pavement. The Dutch bonnet
belonged to his daughter Gwen, a flame-haired dame of
four, demure and serious as any dowager. The child had
a chip-basket full of daffodils in her hand, and she seemed
quite alone, a most responsible young person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A minute gloved hand had gone up with the gravity
of a constable’s paw signalling a lawbreaker to stop.
James Murchison steered to the footway, and regarded
Miss Gwen with a surprised twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, what are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gwen ignored the ungraceful familiarity of the
inquisitive parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll drive home, daddy,” she said, calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—you will! Where’s nurse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mending Jack’s stockings.” And the lady with the
daffodils dismissed the question with contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison laughed, and helped the vagrant into the
car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shopping, I see,” he observed, refraining from adult
priggery, and catching the spirit of Miss Gwen’s adventuresomeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I came out by myself. I’d five pennies in my
money-box. Nurse was so busy. The daffies are for
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father had one eye on the child as he steered the
car through the market-place and past St. Antonia’s
into Lombard Street. The youth in him revolted from
administering moral physic to Miss Gwen. Even the
florist seemed to have treated her pennies with generous
respect, and like the majority of sympathetic males, Murchison
left the dogmatic formalities of education to his
wife. The very flowers, the child’s offering, would have
withered at any tactless chiding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary, the darner of Mr. Jack’s stockings, was discovered
waddling up Lombard Street with flat-footed
haste. Miss Gwen greeted her with the composure of
an empress, proud of her flowers, her father, the motor-car,
and life in general. To Mary’s “Oh—Miss Gwen!”
she answered with a sedate giggle and hugged her basket
of flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison saw his wife’s figure framed between the
white posts of the doorway. He chuckled as he reached
for his instrument bag under the seat, and caught a glimpse
of Mary’s outraged authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, mother, look, you love daffies ever so much.
I bought them all myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s arms were hugging the green frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwen, you wicked one,” and she caught her husband’s
eyes and blushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are growing old fast, Kate. I picked her up in
Chapel Gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dear flowers; come, darling. Jack, you rascal,
what are you doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master Jack! Master Jack!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Male mischief was astir also in Lombard Street, having
emerged from the school-room with the much-tried
Mary’s darning-basket. There was an ironical humor
in pelting the fat woman with the stockings she had mended
and rolled so conscientiously. His father’s appearance
in the hall sent Master Jack laughing and squirming up
the stairs. He was caught, tickled, and carried in bodily
to lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison was smoking in his study early the
same afternoon, ticking off visits in his pocket-book, when
his wife came to him with a letter in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Marley, dear. A man has just ridden in with
it. They need you at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marley? Why, the Penningtons belong to Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore open the envelope and glanced through the
letter, while his wife looked whimsically at the chaos of
books and papers on his desk. The ground was holy,
and her tact debarred her from meddling with the muddle.
The room still had a sense of shadow for her. She could
not enter it without an indefinable sense of dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison did not show the letter to his wife. He
put it in his pocket, knocked out his pipe, and picked up
his stethoscope that was lying on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid you will have to go to the Stantons’
without me, dear,” he said; “Steel wants me at Marley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine gave him a surprised flash of the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker Steel is not fond of asking your advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I, dear,” and he kissed her, and rang the bell
to order out his car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marley was an old moated house some five miles from
Roxton, a place that seemed stolen from a romance, save
that there was nothing romantic about its inmates. A
well-wooded park protected it from the high-road, the
red walls rising warm and mellow behind the yews, junipers,
and cedars that grew in the rambling garden. Spring
flowers were binding the sleek, sun-streaked lawns with
strands of color, dashes of crimson, of azure, and white,
of golden daffodils blowing like banners amid a sheaf of
spears. Here and there the lawns were purple with crocuses,
and the singing of the birds seemed to turn the yew-trees
into towers of song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The panting of Murchison’s car seemed to outrage the
atmosphere of the place, as though the fierce and aggressive
present were intruding upon the dreamy past. A manservant
met the doctor, and led him across the Jacobean
hall to the library, whose windows looked towards the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel was standing before the fire, biting his
black mustache. He had the appearance of a man
whose vanity had been ruffled, and who was having an
unwelcome consultation forced upon him by the preposterous
fussing of some elderly relative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men shook hands, Steel’s white fingers limp
in his rival’s palm. His air of cultured hauteur had fallen
to freezing point. He condescended, and made it a matter
of dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to drag you over here, Murchison. Mr. Pennington
has been on the fidget with regard to his daughter,
and to appease him I elected to send for you at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison warmed his hands before the fire. Steel’s
grandiloquent manner always amused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad to be of any use to you. Who is the patient,
Miss Julia Pennington?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing; only hysteria; the woman’s a tangle of
nerves, a mass of emotions. I have grown to learn her
idiosyncrasies in a year. One month it is palpitation—and
imaginary heart disease, next month she is swearing
that she has cancer of the œsophagus and cannot swallow.
The lady has headaches regularly every other week, and
merges on melancholia in the intervals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the present phase?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Acute migraine and facial neuralgia. She is worrying
about her eyes, seems to see nothing—and everything,
mere hysterical phantasmagoria. The woman is not to
be taken seriously. She is being drenched with bromide
and fed upon phenacetin. Come and see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel led the way from the library as though he
regarded the consultation as a mere troublesome formality,
a pandering to domestic officiousness that had to be
appeased. Miss Julia Pennington was lying on a sofa
in the drawing-room with a younger sister holding her
hand. The room smelled horribly of vinegar, and the
blinds were down, for the patient persisted that she could
not bear the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger lady rose and bowed to Murchison, and
drew aside, with her eyes fixed upon her sister’s face.
Miss Julia was moaning and whimpering on the sofa, a
thin and neurotic spinster of forty with tightly drawn
hair, sharp features, and the peevish expression of a
creature who had long been the slave of a hundred imaginary
ills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison sat down beside her, and asked whether she
could bear the light. His manner was in acute contrast
to Parker Steel’s; the one incisive, almost brusque in his
effort to impress; the other calm, quiet, deliberate, sympathetic
in every word and gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger Miss Pennington drew up the blinds.
Murchison was questioning her sister, watching her face
keenly, while Parker Steel fidgeted to and fro before the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much pain in the eyes, Miss Pennington?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dr. Murchison, the pain is terrible, it runs all
over the face; you cannot conceive—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke away into a chaos of complaints till Murchison
quieted her and asked a few simple questions. He
rose, turned the sofa bodily towards the light, and proceeded
to examine the lady’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things look dim to you?” he asked her, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in a blur, flashes of light, and spots like blood.
I’m sure—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. You have never had anything quite like
this before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, never. I am quite unnerved, Dr. Murchison,
and Dr. Steel won’t believe half the things I tell
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was peevish and irritable. Parker Steel
grinned at the remark, and muttered “mad cat” under
his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are hardly kind to me, Miss Pennington,” he
said, aloud, with a touch of banter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I’m ill, Dr. Steel, very ill—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please lie quiet a moment,” and Murchison bent over
her, closed her lids, and felt the eyeballs with his fingers.
Miss Pennington indulged in little gasps of pain, yet feeling
mesmerized by the quiet earnestness of the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison stood up suddenly, looking grave about the
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind ringing the bell, Steel? I want my bag
out of the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel, who appeared vexed and restless despite his self-conceit,
went out in person to fetch the bag. When he
returned, Murchison had drawn the blinds and curtains
so that the room was in complete darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks; I want my lamp; here it is. I have matches.
Now, Miss Pennington, do you think you can sit up in a
chair for five minutes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thin lady complained, protested, but obeyed him.
Murchison seated himself before her, while Parker Steel
held the lamp behind Miss Pennington. A beam of light
from the mirror of Murchison’s ophthalmoscope flashed
upon the woman’s face. She started hysterically, but
seemed to feel the calming influence of Murchison’s personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Complete silence held for some minutes, save for an
occasional word from Murchison. Parker Steel’s face
was in the shadow. The hand that held the lamp quivered
a little as he watched his rival’s face. There was
something in the concentrated earnestness of Murchison’s
examination that made Mrs. Betty’s husband feel vaguely
uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison rose at last with a deep sigh, stood looking
at Miss Pennington a moment, and then handed the
ophthalmoscope to Steel. The lamp changed hands and
the men places. Miss Pennington’s supply of nerve power,
however, was giving out. She blinked her eyes, put her
hands to her face, and protested that she could bear the
light from the mirror no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel lost patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Miss Pennington, come; I must insist—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, I can’t, the glare burns my eyes out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, my dear lady, control yourself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His irritability reduced Miss Pennington to peevish
tears. She called for her sister, and began to babble
hysterically, an impossible subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel pushed back his chair in a dudgeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see anything,” he said; “utterly hopeless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison drew back the curtains and let dim daylight
into the room. He helped Miss Pennington back
to the sofa, very gentle with her, like a man bearing with
the petulance of a sick child, and then turned to Steel with
a slight frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we talk in the library?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will just put my lamp away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the hall together in silence, and entered
the room with its irreproachable array of books, and the
logs burning on the irons. Murchison went and stood
by one of the windows. A red sunset was coloring the
west, and the dark trees in the garden seemed fringed
with flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel had closed the door. He looked irritable
and restless, a man jealous of his self-esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well? Anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man turned with his hands in his trousers pockets.
Steel did not like the serious expression of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you examined Miss Pennington’s eyes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel shifted from foot to foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no,” he confessed, with an attempt at hauteur,
“I know the woman’s eccentricities. She may be slightly
myopic—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may be stark blind in a week,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Acute glaucoma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Acute glaucoma! Impossible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel took two sharp turns up and down the
room. His mouth was twitching and he looked pale,
like a man who has received a shock. He was conscious,
too, that Murchison’s eyes were upon him, and that his
rival had caught him blundering like any careless boy.
There was something final and convincing in Murchison’s
manner. Parker Steel hated him from that moment with
the hate of a vain and ambitious egotist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound it, Murchison, are you sure of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite sure, as far as my skill serves me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you had much experience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a slight sneer in the question, but Murchison
was proof against the challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I specialized in London on the eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel emitted a monosyllable that sounded remarkably
like “damn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s to be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must consider the advisability of an immediate
iridectomy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard footsteps in the hall. The library door
opened. A spectacled face appeared, to be followed by
a long, loose-limbed body clothed in black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, Dr. Murchison. I have come to inquire—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel planted himself before the fire, a miniature
Ajax ready to defy the domestic lightning. He cast
a desperate and half-appealing look at Murchison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have just seen your daughter, Mr. Pennington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pair of keen gray eyes were scrutinizing the faces of
the two doctors. Mr. Pennington was considered something
of a terror in the neighborhood, a brusque, snappish
old gentleman with a ragged beard, and ill-tempered
wisps of hair straggling over his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, gentlemen, your opinion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison squared his shoulders, and seemed to be
weighing every word he uttered. He was too generous
a man to seize the chance of distinguishing himself at the
expense of a rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, Mr. Pennington, that Dr. Steel and I agree
in the matter. We take, sir, rather a serious view of the
case. Is not that so, Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The supercilious person bent stiffly at the hips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, Steel, you will explain the urgency of the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pennington jerked into a chair, took off his spectacles
and dabbed them with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to have to tell you, sir, that your daughter’s
eyesight is in danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman in the chair started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Eyesight in danger! Bless my bones, why—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Murchison agrees with me, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A peculiarly dangerous condition, sir, developing
rapidly and treacherously, as this rare disease sometimes
does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perspiration was standing out on Parker Steel’s forehead.
He flashed a grateful yet savage glance at Murchison,
and braced back his shoulders with a sigh of
bitter relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think a London opinion would be advisable, Murchison,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, most certainly, in view of the operation
that may have to be performed immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, gentlemen, thank you. I presume this
means my writing out a check for a hundred guineas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your daughter’s condition, sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, of course. Don’t mention the expense.
And you will manage—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel resumed his dictatorship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will wire at once,” he said; “we must lose no time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He accompanied Murchison from the house, jerky and
distraught in manner, a man laboring under a most unwelcome
obligation. The rivals shook hands. There
was much of the anger of the sunset in Parker Steel’s
heart as he watched Murchison’s car go throbbing down
the drive amid the slanting shadows of the silent trees.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s wife, in a depressed and melancholy
mood, wandered restlessly about the house in
St. Antonia’s Square, with the chimes of St. Antonia’s
thundering out every “quarter” over the sleepy town. Mrs.
Betty had attended a drawing-room meeting that afternoon
in support of the zenana missions, and such social
mortifications, undertaken for the good of the “practice,”
usually reduced her to utter gloom. Mrs. Betty was one
of those cultured beings who suffer seriously from the
effects of boredom. Her mercurial temper was easily
lowered by the damp, gray skies of Roxton morality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tea was an infusion of tannin in the pot, and still
the unregenerate male refused to return in time to save a
second brew. Betty Steel had tried one of the latest
novels, and guessed the end before she had read ten pages;
she was an admirer of the ultra-psychological school, and
preferred their bloodless and intricate verbiage to the
simpler and more human “cry.” Even her favorite fog
philosopher could not keep her quiet in her chair. The
desire for activity stirred in her; it was useless to sit still
and court the mopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel went up-stairs to her bedroom, looked through
her jewel-box, folded up a couple of silk blouses in tissue
paper, rearranged her hair, and found herself more bored
than ever. After drifting about aimlessly for a while, she
climbed to the second floor landing, and entered a room
that looked out on St. Antonia’s and the square. A tall,
brass-topped fender closed the fireless grate. There were
pictures from the Christmas numbers of magazines upon
the walls, and rows of old books and toys on the shelves
beside the chimney. In one corner stood a bassinet
hung with faded pink satin. The room seemed very
gray and silent, as though it lacked something, and waited
for the spark of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty looked at the toys and books; they had belonged
to her these twenty years, and she had thought to
watch them torn and broken by a baby’s hands. Parker
Steel’s wife had borne him no children. Strange, cultured
egotist that she was, it had been a great grief to her,
this barrenness, this sealing of the heart. Betty was
woman enough despite her psychology to feel the instincts
of the sex piteous within her. A mother in desire,
she still kept the room as she had planned it after
her marriage, and so spoken of it as “the nursery,” hoping
yet to see it tenanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling depressed and restless, she went to the window
and looked out. Clouds that had been flushed with
transient crimson in the east, were paling before the grayness
of the approaching night. On the topmost branch of
an elm-tree a thrush was singing gloriously, and the
traceried windows of the church were flashing back the
gold of the western sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s wife saw something that made her lips
tighten as she stood looking across the square. Two
children were loitering on the footway, the boy rattling
the railings with his stick, the girl tucking up a doll in a
miniature mail-cart. They were waiting for a tall woman
in a green coat, faced with white, who had stopped to
speak to a laborer whose arm was in a sling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy ran back and began dragging at the woman’s
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mummy, mummy, come along, do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, Wilson, I am so glad you are getting on
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The workman touched his cap, and watched Mrs. Murchison
hustled away impulsively by her two children. The
thrush had ceased singing, silenced by the clatter of Mr.
Jack’s stick. Betty Steel was leaning against the shutter
and watching the mother and her children with a feeling
of bitter resentment in her heart. Even in her home-life
this woman seemed to vanquish her. Catherine Murchison
was taking her children’s hands, while Betty Steel
stood alone in the darkening emptiness of the “nursery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the rushing up of simpler, deeper impulses
made her hurry from the room when she saw her husband’s
carriage stop before the house. He was the one
living thing that she could call her own, and this pale-faced
and cynical woman felt very lonely for the moment
and conscious of the dusk. Parker Steel had signalized
his return by a savage slamming of the heavy door. Betty
met him in the hall. She went and kissed him, and hung
near him almost tenderly as she helped him off with his
fur-lined coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor thing, how late you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband growled, as though he were in no mood
for a woman’s fussing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, dear; you look tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry it up, I’m busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he marched into the dining-room, leaving Betty
standing in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warmer impulses of the moment flickered and died
in the wife’s heart. Her eyes had been tender, her mouth
soft, and even lovable. The slight shock of the man’s
preoccupied coldness drove her back to the unemotional
monotony of life. Husbands were unsympathetic creatures.
She had read the fact in books as a girl, and had
proved it long ago in the person of Parker Steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, dear, you look worried?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband was battering at the sulky fire as though
the action relieved his feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing,” and he kept his back to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty rang the bell for fresh tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a surly dog you are, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound it, can’t you see that I’m dead tired? You
women always want to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel looked at him curiously, and spoke to the
maid who was waiting at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always know, Parker, when you have lost a patient,”
she drawled, calmly, when the girl had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said anything about losing patients?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you quarrelled with old Pennington?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you must know,” and he snapped it out at
her with a vicious grin; “I’ve made an infernal ass of myself
over at Marley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife’s most saving virtue was that she rarely lost
control either of her tongue or of her temper. She could
on occasion display the discretion of an angel, and smile
down a snub with a beatific simplicity that made her seem
like a child out of a convent. She busied herself with
making her husband’s tea, and chatted on general topics
for fully three minutes before referring to the affair at
Marley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You generally exaggerate your sins, Parker,” she said,
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I? Damn that Pennington woman and her humbugging
hysterics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty studied him keenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Miss Julia really and truly ill for once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just wired for Campbell of ‘Nathaniel’s’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idiot’s eyesight is in danger. Old Pennington
got worried about her, and insisted on a consultation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty cut her husband some cake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have sent for Campbell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had Murchison first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fellow spotted the thing. I hadn’t even looked
at the woman’s eyes. Nice for me, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s face had changed in an instant, as though
her husband had confessed bankruptcy or fraud. The
sleek and complacent optimism vanished from her manner;
her voice lost its drawl, and became sharp and almost
fierce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Murchison do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do!” And Parker Steel laughed with an unpleasant
twitching of the nostrils. “Bluffed like a hero, and helped
me through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s bosom heaved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you are at Murchison’s mercy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker, I almost hate you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that woman, of course he will tell her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one ever accused Kate Murchison of being a gossip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will have the laugh of us, that is what makes me
mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel pushed her chair back from the table, and
went and leaned against the mantel-piece. She was white
and furious, she who rarely showed her passions. All
the vixen was awake in her, the spite of a proud woman
who pictures the sneer on a rival’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker!” And her voice sounded hard and metallic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You love Murchison for this, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel gulped down his tea and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker, we must remember this. Lie quiet a while,
and take the fool’s kindnesses. Our turn will come some
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear girl, what are you driving at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Murchisons are our enemies, Parker. I will
show this Kate woman some day that her husband is
not without a flaw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great Sir Thomas Campbell arrived that night at
Roxton, and was driven over to Marley in Steel’s brougham.
The specialist confirmed the private practitioner’s diagnosis,
complimented him gracefully in Mr. Pennington’s
presence, and elected to operate on the lady forthwith.
Parker Steel’s mustache boasted a more jaunty twist
when he returned home that night after driving Sir Thomas
Campbell to the station. He had despatched a reliable
nurse to attend to Miss Julia at Marley, and felt that his
reputation was weathering the storm without the loss of
a single twig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for James Murchison, he kept his own council and
said never a word. Even doctors are human, and Murchison
remembered many a mild blunder of his own.
He received a note in due course from Parker Steel, thanking
him formally for services rendered, and informing
him that the operation had been eminently successful.
Murchison tore up the letter, and thought no more of the
matter for many months. Work was pressing heavily on
his shoulders with influenza and measles epidemic in the
town, and he had his own “dragon of evil” to battle with
in the secret arena of his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gossip is like the wind, every man or woman hears the
sound thereof without troubling to discover whence it
comes or whither it blows. The details of Miss Julia
Pennington’s illness had been wafted half across the
county in less than a week. Nothing seems to inspire the
tongues of garrulous elderly ladies more than the particulars
of some particular gory and luscious slashing of a
fellow-creature’s flesh. Miss Pennington’s ordeal had
been delicate and almost bloodless, but there were vague
and dramatic mutterings in many Roxton side streets,
and gusts of gossip whistling through many a keyhole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at a “Church Restoration” <span class='it'>conversazione</span> at
Canon Stensly’s that Mrs. Steel’s ears were first opened
to the tittle-tattle of the town. The month was May,
and the respectable and genteel Roxtonians had been
turned loose in the Canon’s garden. Mrs. Betty chanced
to be sitting under the shelter of a row of cypresses, chatting
to Miss Gerraty, a partisan of the Steel faction, when
she heard voices on the other side of the trees. The
promenaders, whosoever they were, were discussing Miss
Pennington’s illness, and the tenor of their remarks was
not flattering to Parker Steel. Mrs. Betty reddened under
her picture-hat. The thought was instant in her that
Catherine Murchison had betrayed the truth, and set the
tongues of Roxton wagging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later the two women met on the stretch
of grass outside the drawing-room windows. A casual observer
would have imagined them to be the most Christian
and courteous of acquaintances. Mrs. Betty was smiling
in her rival’s face, though her heart seethed like a mill-pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lovely day! I always admire the Canon’s
spring flowers. Did you absorb all that the architectural
gentleman gave us with regard to the value of flying buttresses
in resisting the outward thrust of the church roof?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I did not listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor did I. Technical jargon always bores me. So
we are to have a bazaar; that is more to the point, so far
as the frivolous element is concerned. I have not seen
Dr. Murchison yet; is he with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was looking at Mrs. Betty’s pale and refined
face. She did not like the woman, but was much too
warm-hearted to betray her feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my husband is too busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Measles in the slums, I hear. Is it true
that you are taking an assistant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine opened her eyes a little at the faint flavor of
insolence in the speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my husband finds the work too heavy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sympathize with you. Dr. Steel never would take
club and dispensary work; not worth his while, you
know; he is worked to death as it is. The curse of popularity,
I tell him. How are the children? I hear the
younger looks very frail and delicate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Steel’s condescension was cunningly conveyed
by her refined drawl. Catherine colored slightly, her
pride repelled by the suave assumption of patronage
Parker Steel’s wife adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwen is very well,” she said, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, one hears so much gossip. Roxton is full of
tattlers. I am often astonished by the strange tales I
hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flashed a smiling yet eloquent look into her rival’s
eyes, and was rewarded by the sudden rush of color that
spread over Catherine Murchison’s face. Mrs. Betty
exulted inwardly. The shaft had flown true, she thought,
and had transfixed the conscience of the originator of the
Pennington scandal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please remember me to your husband, Mrs. Murchison,”
and she passed on with a glitter of the eyes and a
graceful lifting of the chin, feeling that she had challenged
her rival and seen her quail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Catherine was thinking of that frosty night in
March when she had found her husband drink drugged
in his study.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A doctor’s life is not lightly to be envied. Like a
traveller in a half-barbarous country, he must be
prepared for all emergencies, trusting to his own mother-wit
and the resourcefulness of his manhood. He may be
challenged from cock-crow until midnight to do battle
with every physical ill that affects humanity on earth, and
to act as arbiter between life and death. The common
functions of existence are hardly granted him; he is a
species of supramundane creature to whom sleep and
food are scarcely considered vital. However critical the
strain, he must never slacken, never show temper when
pestered by the old women of the sick-room, never lose
the suggestion of sympathy. People will run to catch
him “at his dinner-hour,” poor wretch, and drag him
from bed to discover that some fat old gentleman has
eaten too much crab. Of all men he must appear the
most infallible, the most assured and resolute of philosophers.
He walks on the edge of a precipice, for the
glory of a thousand triumphs may be swallowed up in the
blunder of a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The responsibilities of such a life are heavy, and may
be said to increase with the sensitiveness of the practitioner’s
conscience. The man of heart and of ideals will
give out more of the vital essence than the mere intellectual
who works like a marvellous machine. Yet, flow of
soul is necessary to true success in the higher spheres of
the healing art. There is a vast difference between the
mere chemist who mixes tinctures in a bottle, and the
psychologist whose personality suggests the cure that he
wishes to complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison was a practitioner of the higher
type, a man who wrestled Jacob-like with problems, and
took his responsibilities to heart. He was no clever
automaton, no perfunctory juggler with the woes and
sufferings of his fellows. Life touched him at every turn,
and there was none of the cynical adroitness of the mere
materialist about Murchison. He worked both with his
heart and with his head, a man whose mingled strength
and humility made him beloved by those who knew him
best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter’s work had been unusually heavy, and the
burden of it had not lightened with the spring. Murchison
enjoyed the grappling of difficulties, that keen
tautness of the intellect that vibrates to necessity. Strong
as he was, the strain of the winter’s work had told on him,
and his wife, ever watchful, had seen that he was spending
himself too fast. Interminable night work, the rush
of the crowded hours, and hurried meals, grind down the
toughest constitution. Murchison was not a man to confess
easily to exhaustion, possessing the true tenacity of
the Saxon, the spirit that will not realize the nearness of
defeat. It was only by constant pleading that Catherine
persuaded him to consider the wisdom of hiring help.
Sleeplessness, the worker’s warning, had troubled her
husband as the spring drew on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Wednesday evening in May, Murchison came home
dead tired and faint for want of food. The day had been
rough and stormy, a keen wind whirling the rain in gray
sheets across the country, beating the bloom from the
apple-trees, and laying Miss Gwen’s proud tulips in red
ruin along the borders. Murchison’s visiting-list would
have appalled a man of frailer energy and resolution.
The climbing of interminable stairs, the feeling of pulses,
and all the accurate minutes of the craft, the interviewing
of anxious relatives, slave work in the slums! A premature
maternity case had complicated the routine. Murchison
looked white and almost hunted when he sat down
at last to dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine dismissed the maid and waited on him in
person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, dear, this is very sweet of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him and kissed him on the forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look tired to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite that, dear; I have been rushed off my legs
and the flesh is human.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crocker will send a suitable man down in a day or
two. He can take the club work off your hands. You
have finished for to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay back in his chair, the lines of strain smoothed
from his face a little, the driven look less evident in his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a consultation or two, I hope. I shall get to
bed early. Ah, coffee, that is good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine played and sang to him in the drawing-room
after dinner, with the lamp turned low and a brave fire
burning on the hearth. Murchison had run up-stairs to
kiss his children, and was lying full length on the sofa
when the “detestable bell” broke in upon a slumber song.
The inevitable message marred the relaxation of the
man’s mind and body, and the tired slave of sick humanity
found himself doomed to a night’s watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had read the note that the maid had brought him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No peace for the wicked!” and he almost groaned;
“a maternity case. Confound the woman, she might
have left me a night’s rest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife looked anxious, worried for him in her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How absolutely hateful! Can’t Hicks act for you
to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, I promised my services.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it take long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A first case—all night, probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up wearily, threw the letter into the fire, and
going to his study took up his obstetric bag and examined
it to see that he had all he needed. Catherine was waiting
for him with his coat and scarf, wishing for the moment
that the Deity had arranged otherwise for the
bringing of children into the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall you walk?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is only Carter Street. Go to bed, dear, don’t
wait up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him, and let her head rest for a moment on
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could do the work for you, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, a tired laugh, looking dearly at her, and
went out into the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vague restlessness took possession of Catherine that
night, when she was left alone in the silent house. She
had sent the servants to bed, and drawing a chair before
the fire, tried to forget herself in the pages of romance.
Color and passion had no glamour for her in print, however.
It was as though some silent watcher stood behind
her chair, and willed her to brood on thoughts that
troubled her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put the book aside at last, and sat staring at the
fire, listening to the wind that moaned and sobbed about
the house. The curtains swayed before the windows,
and she could hear the elm-trees in the garden groaning
as though weary of the day’s unrest. There was something
in the nature of the night that gave a sombre setting
to her thoughts. She remembered her husband’s tired
and jaded face, and her very loneliness enhanced her
melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dutch clock in the hall struck eleven, the antique
whir of wheels sounding strange in the sleeping house.
Catherine stirred the fire together, rose and put out the
lamp. She lit her candle in the hall, leaving a light burning
there, and climbed the stairs slowly to her room.
Instinct led her to cross the landing and enter the nursery
where her children slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two little beds stood one in either corner beside
the fireplace, each headed by some favorite picture, and
covered with red quilts edged with white. Gwen was
sleeping with a doll beside her, her hair tied up with a
blue ribbon. The boy had a box of soldiers on the bed,
and one fist cuddled a brass cannon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine stood and looked at them with a mother’s
tenderness in her eyes. They spelled life to her—these
little ones, flesh of her flesh, bone of her bone. They
were her husband’s children, and they seemed to bring
into her heart that night a deep rush of tenderness towards
the man who had given her motherhood. All the
joy and sorrow that they had shared together stole up
like the odor of a sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the strength’s out of a man, the devil’s in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remembered those words he had spoken, and shuddered.
Was it prophetic, this voice that came to her out
of the deeps of her own heart? Tenderly, wistfully, she
bent over each sleeping child, and stole a kiss from the
land of dreams. Betty Steel’s speech recurred to her as
she passed to her own room, feeling lonely because the
arms she yearned for would not hold her close that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine went to bed, but she did not sleep. Her
brain seemed clear as a starlit sky, the thoughts floating
through it like frail clouds over the moon. She heard the
wind wailing, the rain splashing against the windows, the
slow voice of the hall clock measuring out the hours.
Some unseen power seemed to keep her wakeful and
afraid, restless in her loneliness, listening for the sound
of her husband’s return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock struck five before she heard the jar of a
closing door. Footsteps crossed the hall, and she heard
some one moving in the room below. For some minutes
she sat listening in bed, waiting to hear her husband’s
step upon the stairs. Her heart beat strangely when he
did not come; the room felt cold to her as she shivered and
listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden, vague dread seized her. She slipped out of
bed, lit the candle with trembling hands, and throwing
her dressing-gown round her, went out on to the landing.
The lamp was still burning in the hall, and the door of
the dining-room stood ajar. Shading the candle behind
her hand, she went silently down the stairs into the hall.
The only sound she heard was the clink of a glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine stood on the threshold, her hair loose about
her, the candle quivering in her hand. For the moment
there was an agony of reproach upon her face. Then she
had swayed forward, snatched something from the table,
and broke it upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, Kate, forgive me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sank down into a chair and buried his head in his
arms upon the table. Catherine bent over him, her
hands resting on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my beloved, I had dreaded this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miserable beast that I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, you are tired, you are not yourself. Come
with me, come with me, lie in my arms—and rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and buried his face in the warmth of her
bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God you were awake,” he said.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Roxton, that little red town under a June sky,
looked like a ruby strung upon the silver thread of
a river and set in a green hollow of the hills. As yet
the enterprising builder had not stamped the mark of the
beast glaringly upon the place, and the quaint outreachings
of the town were suffered to dwindle through its
orchards into the June meadows, where the deep grass
was slashed and webbed with gold. The hills above
were black with pine thickets that took fire with many
a dawn and sunset, and to the north great beech-woods
hung like purple clouds across the blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most miserly of mortals might have warmed with
the ridge view from Marley Down. Southward a violet
haze of hills, larch-woods golden spired in glimmering
green valleys, bluff knolls massive with many oaks, waving
fields, blue smoke from a few scattered cottages.
From Marley Down with its purple heather billowing between
the pine woods like some Tyrian sea, the road
curled to the red town sleeping amid its meadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty Steel was at least an æsthetician, and her
eyes roved pleasurably over the woods and valleys as she
drove in her smart dog-cart over Marley Down. She had
been ridding her conscience of a number of belated country
“calls” with a friend, Miss Gerratty, beside her, a
plump little person in a pink frock. There was a certain
cottage on Marley Down that Betty Steel had coveted
for months, an antique gem, oak panelled, brick floored,
with great brown beams across the ceilings. Betty Steel
had the woman’s greed for the possession of pretty things.
The house in St. Antonia’s Square seemed too large and
cumbersome for her at times. Perhaps it was something
of a mausoleum, holding the ashes of a dead desire.
Often she wearied of it and the endless domestic details,
and longed for some nook where her restless individualism
could live in its own atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glazier was tinkering at one of the cottage casements
when Mrs. Betty drove up the grass track between sheets
of glowing gorse. A pine wood backed the cottage on
the west; in front, before the little lawn, a white fence
linked up two banks of towering cypresses. Mrs. Betty
drew rein before the gate, and called to the man who was
releading the casement frames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear the cottage is to let. Can you tell me where
Mr. Pilgrim, the owner, lives. Somewhere on the Down,
is it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man, an unpretentious, wet-nosed creature, crossed
the grass plot, wiping his hands on a dirty apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Pilgrim’s just ’ad an offer, miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’re doin’ the repairs. I ’ave ’eard that Mrs.
Murchison of Roxton ’ave taken it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Murchison’s wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How utterly vexatious. I suppose Mr. Pilgrim would
not sell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know, miss, I ’ain’t the authority to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s wife flicked her horse up with the whip
and turned back to the main road, a woman with a
grievance. Her companion in pink offered sympathy
with a twitter. Being of the Steel faction, she was wise
as to the friction between the households, and a friend’s
grievance has always an element of wickedness for a
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How very annoying, dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty waved her whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had that cottage in mind for over a year.
Some one must have told the selfish wretch that I was
after it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strangely like spite, dear,” cooed the dove in pink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what the Murchisons want with the place?
To make a summer beer-garden for their brats, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marley Down’s so bracing. I hear Jim Murchison
has been overworking himself. Probably he intends
spending his week-ends here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather curious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gerratty’s blue eyes were too shallow for the holding
of a mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see anything strange in it, Betty. Jim Murchison
has that assistant of his, a finnicking little fellow
in glasses, with a neck like a giraffe’s. Strange that they
should have snapped up your particular cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s just like Kate Murchison,” and Mrs.
Betty’s brown eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hatred, like love, is a transfiguration of trifles, and
nothing is too paltry to be registered against a foe. Parker
Steel’s wife drove home in the most unenviable of
tempers, untouched by the scent of the bean-fields in
bloom, or by the flash of the river through the green of
June. She rattled down the steep hill into Roxton town
at a pace that made Miss Gerratty wince. Metaphorically,
Betty Steel would have given much to have had her
bit in Catherine Murchison’s mouth, and to have treated
her to a taste of her nimble whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving Miss Gerratty at the end of Queen’s Walk by
the old Jacobean Market-House, Mrs. Steel drove home
alone, to find some half-dozen letters waiting for her,
the mid-day post that she had missed by lunching with
Mrs. Feveril, of The Cedars. She shuffled the letters irritably
through her hands like a pack of cards, her eyes
sparkling into sudden vivacity as a foreign envelope
showed among the rest. The letter bore the Egyptian
Sphinx and pyramids, and the familiar writing of a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter lay unopened in her lap awhile, as she sat
by the open window of the drawing-room and looked out
over the beds that were gorgeous with the flare of Oriental
poppies. The lawn, studded with standard roses, swept
to the trailing branches of an Indian cedar. Rhododendrons
were still in bloom in the little shrubbery under
the rich green shade shed by two great oaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tore open the envelope at last, having lingered like
one who shirks the reading of news long waited for.
The familiar squirl of the man’s handwriting made her
smile, bringing back memories of a first serious <span class='it'>affaire de
cœur</span> with the quaint grotesqueness of the foolish past.
She remembered the thin, raw-boned youth with the red
mouth and the strenuous eyes who had kissed her one
night after a river-party. He was still vivid to her, even
to the recollection how his boating-shirt had slipped a
button and given her a glimpse of a hairy chest. What
a little fool she had been in those days! Mrs. Betty was
not the slave of sentiment, and Surgeon-Major Shackleton
had slipped with his somewhat strenuous love-making
into the past. She still had occasional letters from him,
and from other sundry friends, letters that she always
showed her husband. Parker Steel was not a jealous
being. He was mildly pleased by the conviction that he
was still envied in secret by a bevy of old rivals.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Betty,—”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Steel made a little grimace as she pictured the
number of “dear Betties” who had probably drifted within
the sphere of Charlie Shackleton’s passion for romance.
She skipped through the letter with watchful eyes, ignoring
the surgeon-major’s bantering persiflage, the familiar
gibes of an old friend. It was on the fourth page that
she unearthed the news she delved for, tangled beneath
the splutterings of an execrable pen.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you asked me in your last letter whether I
knew a fellow named Murchison at St. Peter’s. Haven’t
you mentioned ‘the creature’ to me before? I remember
Jim Murchison just as you describe him, a solid, brown-faced
six-footer, one of those happy-go-lucky beggars
who seem ready to punch creation. I left the place two
years before he qualified; he had brains, but if my pate
serves me, he was the sworn slave of a drug we catalogue
as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH. Not a bad sort of fool, but bibulous as
blotting-paper. Funny he should have turned up your
way, and married Kate of the golden hair. Mark this
private, and let my friend Parker deal with the above
formula. Glad to hear that he is raking in the guineas—”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter ended with a few personal paragraphs that
Mrs. Betty hardly troubled to read. She crossed the hall
to her husband’s study, hunted out a text-book on chemistry
from the shelves, and proceeded with much patience
and deliberation to unearth the scientific hieroglyph the
surgeon-major’s letter contained. She found it at last,
and smiled maliciously at its vulgar triteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, ethyl alcohol; commonly known as alcohol;
a generic term for certain compounds which are the
hydroxides of hydrocarbon radicals. The active principle
of intoxicating liquors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty put the book back on the shelf, and buttoned
Mr. Shackleton’s letter into her blouse. There was
a queer glitter in her eyes, a spiteful sparkle of satisfaction.
She went back to the drawing-room, and seating herself
at the piano, played Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song” with
fine verve and feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband found her in a brilliant mood that night
at dinner. She looked sleek and handsome, blood in her
cheeks and mischief in her eyes. Mrs. Betty at her
best could be a very inflammatory and sensuous creature,
like a Greek nymph taken from some Bacchic vase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The latest news, Parker—the Murchisons have snapped
up my cottage on Marley Down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dickens they have! You don’t appear jealous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have a forgiving heart. The place is like a
hermitage. What can the Murchisons want with such a
cottage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband, cold intellectualist, warmed to her beauty
as to true Falernian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I a crystal gazer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read me the riddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel laughed, and looked at her with a slight
loosening of the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Riddle-de-dee! You women are always analyzing
imaginary motives. Murchison has been looking run to
death, lean as an overdriven horse. I don’t blame him
for wishing to munch his oats in rustic seclusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty bubbled over with sparkles of intuition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH stand for, Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH! What on earth have you to do with chemical
formulæ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Answer my question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gin, if you like; the stuff the blue-ribbonites battle
with.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee, the lawyer, and his sister
lived in Lombard Street, in a grim, blind-eyed,
stuccoed house with laurels in tubs before it, and chains
and posts defending an arid stretch of shingle. There
was something about the house that suggested law, a
dry and close-mouthed look that was wholly on the surface.
Porteus Carmagee was a little man, who forever
seemed spluttering and fuming under some grievance.
He was hardly to be met without an irritable explosion
against his own physical afflictions, the delinquencies of
tradesmen and Radicals, or the sins of the boy who
brought the morning paper. The lawyer’s almost truculent
attitude towards the world was largely the result
of “liver”; his sourness was on the surface; one glimpse
of him cutting capers with Kate Murchison’s children
would dissipate the notion that he was a cadaverous and
crusty hater of mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Phyllis Carmagee was remarkable for the utter
unfitness of her Christian name, and for the divine placidity
that contrasted with her brother’s waspishness. A
big, moon-faced, ponderous woman, she was a rock of
composure, a species of human banyan-tree under whose
blessed branches a hundred fretful mortals might rest
in the shade. Her detractors, and they were few, asserted
that she was a mere mass of amiable and phlegmatic fat.
Miss Carmagee was blessed with a very happy sense of
humor; she had a will of her own, a will that was formidable
by reason of its stubborn inertia when once it had
come to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some six years had passed since Miss Carmagee had
deposited herself as a supporter of James Murchison on
his professional platform. Her pleasant stolidity had
done him service, for Miss Carmagee impressed her convictions
on people by sitting down with the serene look
of one who never argues. She was a woman who stated
her opinions with a buxom frankness, and who sat on
opposition as though it were a cushion. She was perhaps
the only woman who gave no sparks to the flint of Mrs.
Steel’s aggressive vivacity. Miss Carmagee’s placidity
was unassailable. To attack her was like throwing pease
against a pyramid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, so you have furnished the cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay back contentedly in her basket-chair—chairs
were the few things that nourished grievances against
her—and beamed on Catherine Murchison, who sat shaded
by the leaves of a young lime. The tea-table stood between
them. Miss Carmagee liked basking in the sun
like some sleek, fat spaniel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is such a dear little place.” And the young wife’s
eyes were full of tenderness. “I want James to keep
the gray hairs from coming too fast. I shall lure him
away to Marley Down, one day in seven, if I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, my dear, you can persuade him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim has such an obstinate conscience. He gives his
best to people, and naturally they overwork him. We
have rivals, too, to consider. I know that Betty Steel is
jealous of us, but then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A touch of wistfulness on Catherine’s face brought Miss
Carmagee’s optimism to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not fear the Steels, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many people—I, for one—don’t trust them. The
woman is too thin to be sincere,” and Miss Carmagee’s
bust protested the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty’s kind enough in her way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When she gets her way, my dear. But tell me about
the cottage. Are the drains quite safe, and are there
plenty of cupboards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was launched into multitudinous details—the
staining of floors, the choosing of tapestries, the latest
bargains in old furniture. It eased her to talk to this
placid woman, for, despite her courage, her heart was sad
in her and full of forebodings for her husband. The
truth had become as a girdle of thorns about her, worn
both day and night. She bore the smart of it without
a flicker of the lids, and carried her head bravely before
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strip of garden, with its prim and old-fashioned
atmosphere, was invaded abruptly by the rising generation.
There was a flutter of feet round the laurel hedge
bordering the path to the front gate, and Mr. Porteus
pranced into view, a veritable light-opera lawyer with
youth at either elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, godma! may I have some strawberries?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Jack Murchison plumped himself emphatically
into Miss Carmagee’s lap, oblivious of the fact that he
was sitting on her spectacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, dear, you must not be so rough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Porteus crossed the grass with the more dignified
and less voracious Dutch bonnet beside him. Miss Gwen
and the bachelor always treated each other with a species
of stately yet twinkling civility. The lawyer’s wrinkles
turned into smile wreaths in the child’s presence, and
there was less perking up of his critical eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a handful for you, Kate; I was ambuscaded
and captured round the corner. Who said strawberries?
Will Miss Gwendolen Murchison deign to deprive the
blackbirds of a few?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you grow stawberries for the blackbirds, godpa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I, Miss Innocent! No, not exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had removed her son and heir from Miss
Carmagee’s lap. The fat lady looked cheerful and unperturbed.
Master Jack was suffered to ruffle her best
skirts with impunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let them eat too much, Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother cocked a birdlike eye at Miss Gwen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixpence for the biggest strawberry brought back
unnibbled. Off with you. And don’t trample on the
plants, John Murchison, Esq.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair raced for the fruit-garden, Master Jack’s enthusiasm
rendering him oblivious to the crime of taking
precedence of a lady. Gwen relinquished the van to
him, and dropped to a demure toddle. Her brother’s
flashing legs suggested the thought to her that it was undignified
to be greedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, Kate, I think you are wanted over the
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carmagee’s sudden soberness of manner brought
the color to Catherine’s cheeks. The lawyer was rattling
the keys in his pocket, and blinking irritably at space.
Intuition warned her that he was more concerned than
he desired her to imagine. She rose instantly, as though
her thoughts were already in her home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye; you will excuse me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over Miss Carmagee and kissed her, her heart
beating fast under the silks of her blouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bring the youngsters over presently, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And send some fruit with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are always spoiling us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Porteus Carmagee accompanied her to the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer rejoined his sister under the lime-tree, biting
at his gray mustache, and still rattling the keys in his
trousers pocket. He walked with a certain jerkiness
that was peculiar to him, the spasmodic and irritable
habit of a man whose nerve-force seemed out of proportion
to his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison’s an ass—a damned ass,” and he flashed a
look over his shoulder in the direction of the fruit-garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Familiarity had accustomed Miss Carmagee to her
brother’s forcible methods of expression. He detonated
over the most trivial topics, and the stout lady took the
splutterings of his indignation as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” and she examined her bent spectacles forgivingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison’s been overworking himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Kate told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man’s a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A conscientious fool, Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carmagee sniffed, and expelled a sigh through his
mustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve warned him over and over again. Idiot! He’ll
break down. They had to bring him home in a cab from
Mill Lane half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister’s face betrayed unusual animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heat stroke, or fainting fit. I saw the cab at the
door, and collared the youngsters as they were coming
round the corner with the nurse. Poor little beggars.
I shall tell Murchison he’s an infernal fool unless he takes
two months’ rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee knew where her brother’s heart lay.
He generally abused his friends when he was most in earnest
for their salvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate will persuade him, Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman’s a treasure. The man ought to consider
her and the children before he addles himself for
a lot of thankless and exacting sluts. Conscience! Conscience
be damned. Why, only last week the man must
sit up half the night with a sweep’s child that had diphtheria.
Conscience! I call it nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee smiled like the moon coming from behind
a cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You approve of Parker Steel’s methods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That little snob!” and the lawyer’s coat-tails gave an
expressive flick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James Murchison only wants rest. Leave him to
Kate; wives are the best physicians often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carmagee’s keys applauded the remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taken a cottage on Marley Down, have they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll recommend a renewal of the honeymoon. Hallo,
here comes the sunlight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Porteus romped across the grass to poke his
wrinkled face into the oval of the Dutch bonnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, who says senna to-night? What! Miss Gwendolen
Murchison approves of senna!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve won that sixpence, godpa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, sir, I think not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack can have the sixpence; it’s his buffday to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady who likes senna and renounces sixpences!
Go to, Master John, you must run to Mr. Parsons, the
clockmaker, and buy godma a pair of new spectacles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spectacles!” and Master Jack mouthed his scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sad day for us, Miss Carmagee, when babies sit
upon our infirmities!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel dropped into his Roxton tailor’s that same
afternoon to have a summer suit fitted. The proprietor,
an urbane and bald-headed person with the deportment
of a diplomat, rubbed his hands and remarked that professional
duties must be very exacting in the heat of
June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your colleague, I understand, sir—Dr. Murchison,
sir—has had an attack from overwork; sunstroke, they
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Sunstroke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have been informed, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or an attack of faintness. Dr. Murchison is a most
laborious worker. Four buttons, thank you; a breast-pocket,
as before, certainly. Any fancy vestings to-day,
doctor? No! Greatly obliged, sir, I’m sure,” and the
diplomat dodged to the door and swung it open with a
bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel found his wife reading under the Indian
cedar in the garden. She was dressed in white, with a
red rose in her bosom, the green shadows of the trees and
shrubs about her casting a sleek sheen over her olive face
and dusky hair. Poets might have written odes to her,
hailing the slim sweetness of her womanliness, using the
lily as a symbol of her beauty and the Madonna-like
radiance of her spiritual face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced up at her husband as he came spruce and
complacent, like any Agag, over the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison has had a sunstroke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Who told you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rudyard, the tailor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book was lying deprecatingly at Mrs. Betty’s feet.
Her eyes swept from her husband to dwell reflectively on
the scarlet pomp of the Oriental poppies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it was a sunstroke, Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband glanced at his neat boots and whistled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a melodramatic mind you have,” he said.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison’s motor-car drew up before
a row of buildings in Mill Lane, a series of brick
boxes that were flattered with the name of “Prospect
Cottages.” So far as prospect was concerned, the back
yard of a tannery offered no “patches of purple” to the
front windows of the row, and the breath that blew therefrom
had no kinship to a land breeze from the Coromandel
coast. In blunt Saxon, Mill Lane stank, and with the
whole-heartedness of a mediæval alley. Over the gray
cobbles that dipped between the houses to the river came
a glimpse of the foam and glitter of the mill pool and the
dull thunder of the wheels and water hummed perpetually
up the narrow street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison swung open the gate, and in three strides
stood at the blistered door of No. 9 Prospect Row. A
painted board hung beside the door bearing a smoking
chimney “proper,” and for supporters two bundles of
sweep’s brushes that looked wondrous like Roman fasces.
The letter-press advertised Mr. William Bains as a
sweeper of chimneys, soot merchant, and extinguisher of
fires. The little front garden was neat as a good housewife’s
linen cupboard, with double daisies along the
borders, and nasturtiums, claret, crimson, and gold, scrambling
up pea-sticks below the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stout woman, who smelled of soup, opened the door
to Murchison and welcomed him with the most robust
good-will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning, doctor; hope I ’aven’t kept you waiting.
Step in, sir, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison stepped in, bending his head by force of
habit, as though accustomed to cottage doorways. Mrs.
Bains in a starched apron made way for him like a ship
in sail. She was a very capable woman, so said her neighbors,
black-eyed, sturdy, with a nose of the retroussé type,
and patches of color over her rather prominent cheek-bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking better, doctor, excuse me saying it.
I can tell you you gave us a bit of a shock when you went
off in that there dead faint on Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bains was a woman with a sanguine temper, a
temper that made her an aggressive enemy, but a very
loyal and active friend. Her black eyes twinkled with
motherly concern as she watched Murchison pull off his
gloves and stuff them into his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me that I have been working too hard,” he
said, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor’, sir, you do work; you don’t do your cooking with
no pepper. I was taking it to myself, sir, the power of
worry we’ve give you over the child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good fight is worth winning, Mrs. Bains. I am
proud of the victory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I reckon none else would ’a’ done it, and so says
the neighbors. Will you step up-stairs, sir? Don’t mind
my man, he’s just scrubbing the soot off ’im.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pair of huge fore-arms, a gray flannel shirt, and a red
face covered with soap-suds saluted Murchison from the
steaming copper in the scullery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-mornin’, sir; ’ope you’re well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, Bains, thanks. Washing the war-paint off,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, sir,” and the sweep grinned good-will and
sturdy admiration; “the kid’s doing fine, I hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could not be better, Bains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you’ve done us a rare good turn, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s eyes smiled at the man’s words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad we won,” he said; “a child’s life is worth
fighting for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It be, sir, it be,” and the sweep swished the soap-suds
from his face till it shone like the sun brightening from
behind a cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison climbed the stairs to the front bedroom, a
room liberally decorated with cheap china and colored
texts. The patient, a little girl, christened Pretoria by
her patriotic parents, lay on the bed beneath the window.
The satiny whiteness of the child’s skin contrasted with
the cherry-pink night-gown that she wore. It had been
a case of diphtheria, a case that would probably have
ended in disaster before the days of serum. Murchison
had sat up half one night, doubtful whether he would not
have to tracheotomize the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, Babs, how’s that naughty throat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down on the edge of the bed and chatted boyishly
to Pretoria, whose shy eyes surveyed him with a
species of delighted adoration. The hero worship that
children give to men is pathetic in its ideal trustfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m better, thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right; you are beginning to know all about it,
eh? Tongue fine and red. She’ll be a talker, Mrs. Bains.
Taking her milk well, yes. Keep her lying down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bains’s big, red hands were fidgeting under her
white apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begging your pardon, doctor, but the child’s been
a-bothering me since you called last, to know whether
she mayn’t give you some flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bains reached across the bed to where a cheap
mug on the window-sill held a posy of pink daisies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re just common things,” said the sweep’s wife,
with an apologetic smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child’s hand went out, and there was a slight
quivering of the bloodless lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the doctor, with Pretoria’s love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison took the flowers tenderly in his strong, deft
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s spoiling me, I should like to know? Aren’t
they beauties? Supposing I put two in my button-hole?
Thank you, little one,” and he bent and kissed the child’s
forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t drop ’em in the street, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pathetic touch of unconscious cynicism went to
the man’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, lose my flowers! You wait, miss, to see
whether I don’t wear some of them to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little white face beamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re that kind to humor the kid, sir,” quoth Mrs.
Bains, with feeling, as she followed Murchison down the
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Mr. William Bains was hanging his clean
face over the garden fence as an example to the neighbors,
when a smart victoria stopped at the upper end of
Mill Lane. A dapper gentleman sprang out, and came
quickly down the footway as though the reek of the tannery
disgusted his polite nostrils. He glanced right and
left with stiff-necked dissatisfaction, his sleek, fashionable
figure reminding one of some aristocratic fragment of
Sheraton plumped down amid battered oddments in some
dealer’s shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. William Bains scanned him, and grunted, noting
the effeminate sag of the shoulders and the glint of the
patent-leather boots. There was a certain insolent gentility
in the dapper figure that made the man of the brawny
fore-arms feel an instinctive and workman-like contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you inform me where a Mrs. Randle lives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sweep caught the white of Dr. Steel’s left eye, and
jerked his pipe-stem laconically at the next cottage down
the lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. 10.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Obliged,” and Parker Steel passed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later the door of No. 10 Prospect Row
was clapped snappishly on the doctor’s heels. It opened
again when the smart physician had regained his carriage
and driven off. A thin woman, with an old cloth
cap perched on her mud-colored hair, came out bare-elbowed.
Her face warned Mr. Bains of the fact that she
was the possessor of a grievance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See the gent come along?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sweep nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sort of kid-gloved gentleman that makes a respectable
woman think of this ’ere charity as an insult. Mrs.
Gibbins sent him to see my Tom. I’m thinking she
might as well mind ’er business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bains cocked his pipe and chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Steel’s one of the smart ’uns,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toff! I’d like to give ’im toffee! Comes into my
’ouse with ’is ’at on, and looks round ’im as though ’e
was afraid to touch the floor with ’is boots. Sh’ld ’ear
’im talk, just as though ’is voice ’adn’t any stomach in it.
I told ’im we had Murchison, Mrs. Gibbins or no Mrs.
Gibbins. ’E looked me over as though I was a savage,
and said, ‘Haw, yes, Dr. Murchison ’as all the parish
cases, I believe.’ ‘And a good job, sir,’ says I. Lor’,
I wouldn’t as much as scrub ’is dirty linen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bains fingered his chin and sucked peacefully at
his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I likes brawn in a man,” he said, “and a big voice,
and a bit of spark in th’ eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t give me any of yer ‘trousers stretchers’ or yer
fancy weskits—Murchison’s my man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grit, blessed grit to the bone of ’im.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a real gentleman. Takes ’is ’at off in a ’ouse.
T’other chap ’ain’t no manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a cheap age, and cheap sentiment satisfies the
masses, a mere matter of melodrama in which the villain
is hissed and the “stage child” applauded when she
points to heaven and invokes “Gawd” through her cockney
nose. Sentiment in the more delicate phases may
be either the refinement of hypocrisy or the shining out
of the godliness in man. The trivial incidents of life may
betray the true character more finely than the throes of
a moral crisis. The average male might have dropped
Miss Pretoria’s flowers round the nearest corner, or
thrown them into his study grate to wither amid cigar
ends and burned matches. James Murchison kept the
flowers and gave them to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put them in water, dear, for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From a lady, sir?” and Catherine’s eyes searched the
lines upon his face. She was jealous for his health, but
her eyes were smiling. Dearest of all virtues in a woman
are a brave cheerfulness and a tactful tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband kissed her, and it was a lover’s kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thank-offering, dear, from the Bains child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How sweet! Somehow I always treasure a child’s
gift; it seems so fresh and real.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little beggar,” and he smiled as he spoke. “I
wouldn’t have lost that life, Kate, for a very great deal.
It was something to feel that fellow Bains’s hand-grip
when I told him we had won.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was settling the flowers in a glass bowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just a bit of life, dear,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is life that tells. I think I would rather have
saved that child, Kate, than have written the most brilliant
book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to him and put her arms about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the true man in you,” and her eyes honored
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kiss me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marriage had been no problem play for these two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine lay thinking that night, with her hair in
tawny waves upon the pillow, waiting for her husband
to come to bed. She was happier and less troubled at
heart than she had been for many weeks. The strain had
lessened for her husband with the summer, and he seemed
his more breezy, strenuous self, a great child with his
children, a man who appeared to have no dark comers
in the house of life. Wilful optimist that she was, she
could not conceive it possible that a mere “inherited lust”
could bear down the man whose strength and honor were
bound up for her in her religion. Where great love exists,
great faith lives also. Catherine was too ready, perhaps,
to forget her fears, to regard them as mere thunder-clouds,
black for the hour, but destitute of heavier dread. She
ascribed his momentary weakness to the brain strain of
the winter’s work. The words that had terrified her in
Porteus Carmagee’s garden had proved but a fantasy,
for a trick of the heart had explained the incident and
given the denial to Mrs. Betty’s insinuations. The
ordeal need never be repeated, so she told herself. Murchison
could be saved from overwork. The assistant he
had engaged was a youngster of tact and education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Love will stand trustfully through the storm, under a
tree, braving the lightning; nor had Catherine realized
how vivid his own frailty appeared to the man she loved.
He was sitting alone in his study while she comforted herself
with dreams in the room above, his head between his
hands, his heart heavy in him for the moment. An inherited
habit is never to be despised. The gods of old
were prone to mortal weakness in the flesh, and no man
is so masterful that he can command his own destiny unshaken.
We are what the world and our ancestors have
made us. The individual hand is there to hold the tiller,
but even a Ulysses must meet the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned his tired face towards the light,
heaved back his shoulders, and sighed like a man in pain.
He rose, put out the lamp, locked the study door, and
taking his candle went up to his dressing-room that looked
out on the garden. The blind was up, the window open,
the darkness of space afire with many stars. He stood
awhile at the open window in deep thought, letting the
night breeze play upon his face. He was glad of his
home life, glad that a woman’s arms were waiting for
him, ready to shelter him from himself. He thanked
God, as a strong man thanks God, for blessings given.
The breath of his home was sweet to him, its life full of
tenderness and good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife’s bedroom had an air of delicacy and refinement
with its cherished antique furniture, its linen curtains
flowered with red, the paper and carpet a rich green.
Candles in brass sticks were burning on the dressing-table,
where a silver toilet-set—brushes, mirror, combs,
and pin-boxes—recalled to the wife her marriage day.
There were books—red, green, and white—on a copper-bound
book-shelf over the mantel-piece. The room suggested
that those who slept in it had kept the romance of
life untarnished and unbedraggled. There was no slovenly
realism to hint at apathy or the materialism of desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been reading, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, reading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was not a man who could act what he did
not feel. He looked at his wife’s face on the pillow, and
wondered at the beauty of her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good to see you there, Kate,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unrestrainable wistfulness of his look made her
arms flash out to him. He knelt down beside the bed
and let her fondle him with her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You regret nothing, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Regret!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always in my mind—this curse. I am not a
coward, Kate, but I go in deadly fear at times of my own
flesh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always—this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would to God I could bear it all myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” and she hung over him; “I understand, I
am not afraid. You must rest; we will go away together
to the cottage—a little honeymoon. You are not yourself
as yet. Oh, my beloved, I want you here, here—at
my heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness enveloped them, and she pillowed her husband’s
head upon her shoulder. He heard her heart
beating, heard the drawing of her breath. In a little
while he fell asleep, but Catherine lay awake for many
hours, her love hovering like some sacred flame of fire
over the tired man at her side.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A white-capped servant came running across
Lombard Street from Mr. Carmagee’s, and hailed
Murchison’s chauffeur, who had just swung the car to the
edge of the footway outside the doctor’s house. The
white streamers of the maid’s apron were fluttering jauntily
in the wind. Some weeks ago the chauffeur had discovered
the fact that the lawyer’s parlor-maid had an attractive
simper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, miss; can I oblige a lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Carmagee wants to know whether the doctor and
the missus are going to Marley Down this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, straight away. I’m waiting for ’em to finish tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re to step over to Mr. Carmagee’s garden door
at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. And who’s to mind the car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t catch cold,” and the maid showed her dimples
for a bachelor’s benefit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chauffeur crossed the road with her, and was met
at the green gate in the garden by Mr. Porteus himself.
A hamper lay on the gravel-path at the lawyer’s
feet, with straw protruding from under the lid. Mr.
Carmagee twinkled, and gave the man a shilling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow this in the car, Gage; you’ve room, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say anything about it to your master. Just a
little surprise, a good liver-tonic, Gage—see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man grinned, touched his cap, and, picking up the
hamper, recrossed the street. He packed Mr. Carmagee’s
offering away with the light luggage at the back of the
car, and after grimacing at the maid, who was still watching
him from the garden door, busied himself with polishing
the lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, darling, good-bye. Be a good boy, Jack,
and do what Mary tells you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was bending over her two children in the
hall, a light dust cloak round her, a white veil over her
summer hat. Miss Gwen, looking a little pensive and
inclined to weep, hugged her mother with a pair of very
chubby arms. Master Jack was more militant, and inclined
to insist upon his rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, mother, I don’t call it fair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall come next week, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gage says he’ll teach me to drive. I’ll come next
week. You’ve promised now—you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine kissed him, and laughed like a young bride
when her husband came up and lifted the youngster off
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who wants to boss creation, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master John clapped his heels together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no fun with old Mary, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must learn to be a philosopher, my man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to buy a busting big pea-shooter at Smith’s,”
quoth the heckler, meaningly, as he regained the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison caught his daughter up in his strong arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, my Gwen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dood-bye, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No tears, little sunlight. What is it, a secret?—well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child was whispering in his ear. Murchison
listened, fatherly amusement shining in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put ’em in muvver’s bag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I’ll see to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re boofy; I tried one, jus’ one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison laughed, and hugged the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a wicked fay it is! You shall come with us
next time. We’ll have tea in the woods, stir up ant-heaps,
and play at Swiss Family Robinson. Good-bye,” and
he carried her with him to the door to take her child’s kiss
as the sunlight touched her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summer on Marley Down was a pageant such as painter’s
love. Heather everywhere, lagoons of purple amid
the rich green reefs of the rising bracken. Scotch firs
towering into mystery against the blue, roofing magic
aisles where shadows played on grass like velvet, bluff
banks and forest valleys, heather and whortleberry tangling
the ground. In the marshy hollows of the down the
moss was as some rich carpet from the Orient, gold, green,
and bronze. Asphodel grew in these rank green hollows,
with the red whorls of the sundew, and the swinging
sedge. Everywhere a broad, breezy sky, brilliant with
color above a brilliant world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palings of the cottage-garden glimmered white
between the sombre cypresses, and the dark swell of the
fir-wood topped the red of the tiled roof. This nook in
Arcady had the charm of a surprise for Murchison, for
Catherine had made him promise that he would leave
the stewardship to her. She had spent many an hour
over at Marley Down, and her year’s allowance from her
mother had gone in art fabrics, carpets, and old furniture.
Catherine had taken Gwen with her more than
once, having sworn the child to secrecy on these solemn
motherly trifles, and Gwen had hidden her bubbling enthusiasm
even from her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are! Is it not a corner of romance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place looks lovely, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” and she seemed happily mysterious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can guess your magic. Carry the luggage in, Gage;
Dr. Inglis may want you for an hour or two at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave his hand to Catherine, and together they passed
into the little garden. Murchison looked about him like
a man who had put the grim world out of his heart. The
peacefulness of the place seemed part of the woodland
and the sky. Purple clematis was in bloom, with a white
rose over the porch. The beds below the windows were
fragrant with sweet herbs, lavender and thyme, rosemary
and sage. A crimson rambler blazed up nearly to the
overhanging eaves, and there were rows of lilies, milk
white, beneath the cypress-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within, a woman’s careful and happy tenderness welcomed
him everywhere. A dozen nooks and corners betrayed
where Catherine’s hands had been at work. Flowered
curtains at the casements; simple pottery, richly
colored, on the window shelves; his favorite books; a
great lounge-chair for him before an open window. The
place was a dream cottage, brown beamed, brown floored,
its walls tinted with delicate greens and reds, old panelling
beside the red brick hearths, beauty and quaintness everywhere,
flowers in the garden, flowers in the quiet room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a haven of rest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood in the little drawing-room, looking about him
with an expression of deep contentment on his face.
Catherine knew that his heart thanked her, and that her
simple idyl was complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and put his arm across her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have worked hard, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I?” and she laughed and colored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all good. I am wondering whether I deserve so
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her happy silence denied the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your spirit is in the place, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart, perhaps,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent and kissed her, and drew from her with smiling
mouth as they heard the man Gage come plodding down
the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped at the door and touched his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in, sir. I’ve put your bag in what the old lady
told me was your dressing-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Gage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any message to Dr. Inglis, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ask him to call at Mrs. Purvis’s in Carter Street;
I forgot to put her on the list.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, sir,” and they heard the clash of the garden
gate; then the panting of the car, and the plaintive wail
of the “oil horse” as it got in gear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out—old world,” and Murchison swept his wife
towards the piano; “give me a song, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now?” and her eyes were radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I shall remember the first song you sing to me
in this dear place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had gone to her room, when Murchison
stumbled on the hamper that Porteus Carmagee had
given the man Gage to carry in the car. The fellow had
set it down in the little hall, between an oak settle and a
table that held a bowl of roses by the door. Murchison
imagined that his wife had been investing in china or
antiques. A letter was tucked under the cord, and, looking
closer, he recognized his own name and the lawyer’s
scrawl, the “qualifications” added with a humorous
flourish of Mr. Carmagee’s pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison sat on the oak settle, opened the envelope,
and drew out the paper with its familiar crest.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Fellow</span>,—Being a hearty admirer of your
wife’s management of your health, I, a ridiculous bachelor,
presume to afflict you with medicine of my own, gratis.
I send you half a dozen bottles of Martinez’s 1887, as good
a port as you will find in any cellar. I know that you are
an abstemious beggar, but take the stuff for the tonic it
is, and drink to an ‘incomparable’ wife’s health. The
wine has purpled me out of the gray dumps on many an
occasion. Not that you will need it, sir, for such a disease.
Chivalry forbid!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours ever,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Porteus Carmagee</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P. S.—Gage is smuggling this over for me in the
car.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison read the letter through as though this eccentric
but lovable gentleman had written to bully him
on behalf of some injured client. Six bottles of Martinez’s
1887, plumped by this dear old blunderer into Kate’s
haven of refuge! Had Murchison believed in the personal
existence of the devil, he would have imagined that
the Spirit of Evil had bewitched the innocent heart of
Mr. Porteus Carmagee. Good God! what a frail fool
he was that such a thing should have the least significance
for him! James Murchison scared by a drug in a bottle!
And yet the first impulse that he had was to dash the
hamper on the floor, and watch the red juice dye the
stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard his wife singing in her room above, singing
with that tender yet subdued abandonment that goes
with a happy heart. He heard the door open, her footstep
on the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started as though guilty, and crumpled the letter
in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like supper now, and a walk later? There
will be a moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us have supper,” he answered back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come in a minute. Have you seen the sunset?
It is grand over the heath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went back into her bedroom, humming some old
song, her very happiness hurting the man’s heart. What
was this lust, this appetite, this thirst in the blood, that it
should make him the creature of such a chance? Had
he not free will, the self-respecting strength of his own
manhood? Strange irony of life that six bottles of choice
wine should typify the father’s sins visited upon the
children! A scientific platitude! And yet the thought
was pitiful to him, pitiful that the spiritual beauty of a
woman’s love could be challenged by such a pathetic
thing as this. He had grappled and thrown the passion
time on time, and yet it had slunk away to come grinning
back to him with open mouth and burning eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still sitting on the settle with the letter crumpled
in his hand, when Catherine called to him again from her
bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do look at the sky, dear, it is wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife’s innocent happiness stung him with its unconscious
pathos. She had conceived this Eden for him,
and lo—the serpent was amid the flowers her hands had
gathered. He roused himself, picked up the hamper by
the cord, and carried it into the little dining-room beyond
the hall. Ignorance was bliss for her; knowledge would
dash her joyous confidence in a moment. There was no
need for her to know; he felt sure of himself, safe with her
in such a place. Looking round him a moment, he pushed
the hamper under the deep window-seat, where it was
hidden by the drapings. Poor Porteus, how little he
thought that an asp lurked under the leaves of the
vine!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A full moon was rising in the east when husband and
wife went out into the garden. The glimmering witchery
of the night bathed the world in silent splendor. From the
cottage the broad swell of the heathland rolled back under
the sky to where a forest of firs rose like distant peaks
against the moon. Mists, white and ghostly, were rising
in the meadows of the plain, vistas of woodland, vague
and mysterious, shining up through the gathering vapor.
In the garden the scent of the lilies mingled with the old
world sweetness of the herbs. The flowers stood white
before the cypresses, and the dew was falling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a sound save the distant baying of a dog. Murchison
opened the little gate to the path that wound amid
the gorse and heather. The turmoil and clamor of the
world seemed far from them under the moonlit sky; the
breath of the night was cool and fragrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s head was on her husband’s shoulder, his
arm about her body. She leaned her weight on him with
the happy instinct of a woman, her face white towards
the moon, her eyes full of the light thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight years,” she said, as though speaking her inmost
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight years!” and he echoed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember that night at Weybourne? It was
just such a night as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arm tightened about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Memories are like books,” he said, “a few live in our
hearts through life, the rest, like the bills we pay, are read,
and then forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were very nervous.” And she laughed, alluringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can remember stammering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how you held my wrist?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like that,” and he proved that he had not forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wandered on for a while in silence, looking towards
the fir-woods whose spires were touched by the light
of the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope the children are asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that poor Mary has not been blinded by your
son’s propensity for blowing pease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack will be like you, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor child, he might do better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke lightly, caught up self-consciousness, and
sighed. His wife’s eyes looked swiftly at his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You feel that you can rest here, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With you, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt the pressure of his hand, and saw his mouth
harden, his brows contract a little. The subject saddened
him, brought back the introspective mood, and recalled
the darker past. Catherine broke from it instinctively,
knowing that it was poor comfort to let him brood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are your plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we walk to Farley church?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I love the old place, the cedars and yews shading
the graves. It has repose—poetry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind recoiled on happier things. Catherine felt
it, and was comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I often went to Farley as a child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The memory suits you, dear. I can see a little, golden-headed
woman sitting in the sunlight in one of those
black old pews.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was like our Gwen, but more noisy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwen cannot do better than repeat her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon sailed high over Marley Down when husband
and wife returned to the cottage. The old village
woman whom Catherine had hired had lit the lamp in the
small drawing-room, and the warm glow flooded through
the casement upon the flowers and the dew-drenched
grass. Catherine wandered to the piano, her husband
lying in the chair before the open window. She played
and sang to him, the old songs she had sung when they
had been betrothed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose at last, and, bending over him, put her arms
about his neck, while his hands held hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dustman, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked through the window at the black sweep of
the heath and the stars above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall sit up awhile, dear, and do some work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work, traitor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced up at her with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought a ledger over with me. No time like the
sweet and idle present. There are such things as bills,
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine brushed the commonplace aside with a woman’s
adroitness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, an hour’s exile, and no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, till you come—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him, glided away, and went up to her room,
humming one of Schubert’s songs.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison sat for a while before the open window
after his wife had gone to bed. He could hear her
moving to and fro in the room above him, the only sound
in the silence of the night. He was at rest, and happy,
her very nearness filling him with a sense of peace and
strength. The tenderness of her love breathed in the
air, and he still seemed to hear her radiant singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We mortals are often in greater peril of a fall when we
trust in the cheerful temerity of an imagined strength.
To a man standing upon the edge of a precipice the lands
beneath seem faint and insignificant, and yet but a depth
of air lies between him and the plain. Our frailties may
seem pitiful, nay, impossible to us when we listen to
noble music, or watch the sunrise on the mountains.
The man who is exalted in the spirit lives in a clearer
atmosphere, and wonders at the fog that may have drifted
round him yesterday. He may even laugh at the <span class='it'>alter
ego</span> framed of clay, and ask whether this soft-bodied,
cringing thing could ever have answered to the name of
“self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some such feeling of optimism took possession of Murchison
that night. The words of his wife’s songs were in
his brain; he heard her moving in the room above, and
felt the dearness of her presence in the place. Everywhere
he beheld the work of her hands—the curtains at
the windows, the flowers in the bowls. Her photograph
stood on the mantel-shelf, and he rose and looked at it,
smiling at the eyes that smiled at him. Could he, the
husband of such a woman, and the father of her children,
be the mere creature of the juice of the grape? Was he
no stronger than some sot at a street corner? He gazed
at his own photograph that stood before the mirror,
gazed at it critically, as though studying a strange face.
The eyes looked straight at him, the mouth was firm, the
jaw crossed by a deep shadow that betrayed no degenerate
sloping of the chin. Was this the face of a man who was
the victim of a lust? He smiled at the memory of his
weaker self as a man smiles at a rival whom he can magnanimously
pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pride of strength suggested the thought of proof.
Old Porteus Carmagee had sent him this choice wine,
and was he afraid of six bottles in a basket? Why not
challenge this <span class='it'>alter ego</span>, this mean and treacherous caricature
of his manhood, and prove in the grapple that he
was the master of his earthly self? There was a combative
stimulus in the thought that appealed to a man
who had been an athlete. It fired the element of action
in him, made him knit his muscles and expand his chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison looked at himself steadily in the mirror,
held up his hand, and saw not the slightest tremor. He
crossed the hall, entered the dining-room, and dragged the
hamper from under the window-seat with something of
the spirit of a Greek hero dragging some classic monster
from its lair. Coolly and without flurry he carried the
thing into the drawing-room and set it down on the little
gate-legged table. He cut the cord, raised the lid, and
let the musty fragrance of the lawyer’s cellar float out
into the room. The simile of Pandora’s box did not
occur to him. He put the straw aside, and pulled out a
cobwebbed bottle from its case. His knife served him
to break up the cork; he sniffed the wine’s bouquet, and
looked round him for a glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found one among Catherine’s curios, an old Venetian
goblet of quaint shape. Half filling it, he tossed
Porteus Carmagee’s letter on to the straw, and standing
before his wife’s portrait, looked steadily into the smiling
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate, I drink to you. One glass to prove it, and the
open bottle left untouched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deliberately he raised the glass and drank, looking at
his wife’s face in its framing of silver on the mantel-shelf.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>More than two hours had passed since she had left
him, and Catherine was lying awake, watching the moonlight
glimmering on the moor. Her heart was tranquil
in her, her thoughts free from all unrest as she lay in the
oak bed, happily lethargic, waiting for her husband’s step
upon the stairs. The day had been very sweet to her,
and there was no shadow across the moon. She lay
thinking of her children, and her childhood, and of the
near past, when she had first sung the songs that she had
sung to the man that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crash of broken glass and the sound of some heavy
body falling startled Catherine from her land of dreams.
She sat up, listening, like one roused from a first sleep.
Murchison must have turned out the lamp and then
blundered against some piece of furniture in the dark.
If it were her treasured and much-sought china! She
slipped out of bed, opened the door, and went out on to
the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrow hall lay dark below her, and she won no
answer from her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hurt, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no reply; the door was shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crept down the stairs, and stepped on the last step.
A curious, “gaggling” laugh came from the room across
the hall. At the sound she stiffened, one hand holding
the bosom of her laced night-gear, the other gripping the
oak rail. A sudden blind dread smote her till she seemed
conscious of nothing save the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, are you coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she heard that mockery of a laugh, and a kind
of senseless jabbering like the babbling of a drunken man.
A rush of anguish caught her heart, the anguish of one
who feels the horror of the stifling sea. She tottered,
groped her way back into her room, and sank down on
the bed in an agony of defeat. Was it for this that her
love had spent itself in all the tender planning of this
little place? How had it happened? Not with deceit!
Even in her blindness she prayed to God that he had not
wounded her with willing hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God, not that, not that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose, catching her breath in short, sharp spasms,
shaking back the hair from off her shoulders. The torture
was too sharp with her for tears. It was a wringing
of the heart, a dashing of all devotion, a falling away of
happiness from beneath her feet! She stretched out her
arms in the dark like a woman who reaches out to a love
just dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine turned, saw the empty bed, and the white
face of the moon. The memories of the evening rushed
back on her, wistful and infinitely tender. “No, no, no!”
Her heart beat out the contradiction like a bell. It was
unbelievable, unimaginable, that he should have played
the hypocrite that night. They had spoken of the children,
their children, and would he have lied to her, knowing
that this vile devil’s drug was in the house? Her
heart cried out against the thought. Her love came forth
like an angel with a burning sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With white hands trembling in the moonlight, Catherine
lit her candle, slipped her bare feet into her shoes,
and went down the stairs. The inarticulate and pitiable
mumbling still came from the little room. In the hall
she halted, irresolute, the candle wavering in her hand.
The shame of it, the pity of it! Could she go in and see
the “animal” stammering in triumph over the “man”?
No, no, it would be desecration, ignominy, an unhallowed
wounding of the heart. He would sleep presently. The
madness would flicker down like fire and die. Yes, she
would wait and watch till he had fallen asleep. To see
him in the throes of it, no, she could not suffer that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a dry sob in the throat, Catherine set the candle
down on the table, beside the bowl of roses that she had
arranged but yesterday with her own hands. How cold
the house was, even for summer! She returned to her
bedroom, took down her dressing-gown from behind the
door, and wrapped it round her, thanking Heaven in her
heart that she was alone with her husband in the house.
The village woman slept away, and came at seven in the
morning. She had all the night before her to recover her
husband from his shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going down to the hall again, she walked to and fro,
listening from time to time at the closed door. The restless
babbling of the voice had ceased. The fumes were
dulling the wine fire in his brain. She prayed fervently
that he would fall asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour passed, and she heard no sound save the sighing
of her own breath. For a moment the pathos of it
overcame her as she leaned against the wall, the child in
her crying out for comfort, for she felt alone in the emptiness
of the night. The weakness lasted but a second. She
grappled herself, opened the door noiselessly and looked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lamp was still burning in the room, its shade of
crocus yellow tempering the light into an atmosphere of
mellow gold. On the gate-legged table stood Porteus
Carmagee’s ill-omened hamper, the lid open, and straw
scattered about the floor. Fragments of broken glass
glittered among the litter, with the twisted stem of the
Venetian goblet. An empty bottle had trackled its lees
in a dark blot on the green of the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine would not look at her husband for the moment.
She was conscious of a shrunken and huddled
figure, a red and gaping face, the reek of the wine, the
heavy sighing of his breath. Her nerve had returned to
her with the opening of the closed door. Her heart knew
but one great yearning, the prayer that the downfall had
not been deliberately cruel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sheet of note paper lay crumbled amid the straw.
She stooped and reached for it, and recognized the writing.
It was Porteus Carmagee’s half-jesting letter, and
she learned the truth, how the fatal stuff had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that you are an abstemious beggar, but take
the stuff for the tonic it is, and drink to an ‘incomparable’
wife’s health.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gage is smuggling this over for me in
the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood holding the letter in her two hands, and looking
at the senseless figure on the floor. Love triumphed
in that ordeal of the night. There was nothing but pity
and great tenderness in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” and she caught her breath; “thank
God, you did not do this wilfully! Oh, my beloved, if
I had known!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The surest test of a man’s efficiency is to leave him
in a responsible post with nothing to trust to save
his own skill and courage. Young doctors, like raw
soldiers, are prone to panic, and your theoretical genius
may bungle over the slitting of a whitlow, though he
be the possessor of numberless degrees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mere book lore never instilled virility into a man, and
Frederick Inglis, B.A., A.M., B.Sc., D.Ph., gilded to the
last button with the cleverness of the schools, was an
amiable fellow whose cultured and finnicking exterior
covered unhappy voids of self-distrust. It had been very
well for him so long as he could play with a few new drugs,
look quietly clever, and leave the grimness of the responsibility
to Murchison. Dr. Inglis had found private practice
a pleasant pastime. He had come from the laboratories
full to the brim with the latest scientific sensations,
and a preconceived pity for the average sawbones in the
provinces. He boasted a brilliant air so long as he was
second in command. It was possible to pose behind the
barrier of another man’s strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same Saturday night Murchison’s highly educated
assistant had been dragged out of bed at two in the morning,
and taken in a bumping milk-cart to a farm some
five miles north of Roxton. His youth had been flouted
on the very threshold by a stern, keen-eyed woman who
had expressed herself dissatisfied with the offer of a juvenile
opinion. Dr. Inglis had blushed, and rallied his dignity.
Dr. Murchison had intrusted the practice to him;
what more could a mere farmer’s wife desire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, in a big bed, Dr. Inglis discovered a fat man
writhing with what appeared to be a prosaic and violent
colic. A simple case, perhaps, to the lay understanding,
but abdominal diagnosis may be a nightmare to a surgeon.
It is like feeling for a pea through the thickness of a pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two straight-backed, hard-faced, and very awesome
ladies stood at the bottom of the bed and watched Dr.
Inglis with sceptical alertness. The assistant fumbled,
stammered, and looked hot. The women exchanged
glances. A man’s personal fitness is soon gauged in a
sick-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doctor, what’s your opinion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The challenge was given with a tilt of the nose and a
somewhat suggestive sniff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abdominal colic, madam. The pain is often very
violent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, eh, and what may abdominal colic be due to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Inglis bridled at the tone, and attempted the part
of Zeus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many causes, very many causes. Mr. Baxter has
never had such an attack before, I presume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—how are you feeling, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad, mighty bad,” came the voice from the feather
pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two austere women seemed to grow taller and
more aggressive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you understand the case, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Dr. Murchison had come himself; my husband
has such faith in him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Inglis grew hot with noble indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you please,” he said, with hauteur, yet looking
awed by the tall women beside the bed. “My qualifications
are as good as any man’s in Roxton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conceit failed before those two hard and Calvinistic
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe in experience, sir; no offence to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you wish me to send for Dr. Murchison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the theoretical youth experienced guilty relief despite
the insult to his age and dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday morning came with a flood of gold over Marley
Down. The greens and purples were brilliant beyond
belief; a blue haze covered the distant hills; woodland and
pasture glimmered in the valleys. The faint chiming of
the bells of Roxton stirred the air as Kate Murchison
walked the garden before the cottage, looking like one
who had been awake all night beside a sick-bed. Her
face betrayed lines of exhaustion, a dulling of the natural
freshness, streaks of shadow under the eyes. She had
that half-blind expression, the expression of those whose
thoughts are engrossed by sorrow; the trick of seeing
without comprehending the significance of the things
about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned suddenly by the gate, and stood looking
over the down. The very brilliancy of the summer coloring
almost hurt her tired eyes. A familiar sound drowned
the Roxton chiming as she listened, and brought a sharp
twinge of anxiety to her face. Rounding the pine woods
the rakish outline of her husband’s car showed up over
the banks of gorse between the cottage and the high-road.
The machine came panting over the down, leaving a
drifting trail of dust to sully the sunlight. Catherine
caught her breath with impatient dread. This day of all
days, when defeat was heavy on her husband! Could
they not let him rest? If these selfish sick folk only
knew!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Inglis’s gold-rimmed pince-nez glittered nervously
over the fence. He was a spare, boyish-looking fellow,
with twine-colored hair, weak eyes, and a mouth that attempted
resolute precision. Catherine hated him for the
moment as he lifted his hat, and opened the gate with a
deprecating and colorless smile. Dr. Inglis had the air
of a young man much worried, one whose self-esteem had
been severely ruffled, and who had been forbidden sleep
and a hearty breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning. A mean thing, I’m sure, to bother
Dr. Murchison, but really—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine met him, looking straight and stanch in
contrast to the theorist’s faded feebleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Baxter, of Boland’s Farm, is seriously ill. An
obscure case. His wife wishes—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine foreshadowed what was to come. The assistant
appeared to have suffered at the hands of anxious
and nagging relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A serious case, I’m afraid. I am sure Dr. Murchison
would not wish me to assume all the responsibility. The
wife, Mrs. Baxter, is rather an excitable woman—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His apologetics would have been amusing at any other
season. Catherine bit her lip and ignored the limp
youth’s deprecating and sensitive distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They wish to see my husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I must suggest, Mrs. Murchison—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand the matter perfectly. Dr. Murchison
cannot come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was bold, nay, aggressive, and the theorist looked
blank behind his glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I to infer—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Murchison is not well,” and she hesitated, groping
fiercely for excuses; “he has had—I think—some kind
of ptomaine poisoning. Yes, he is better now, and asleep.
I cannot have him disturbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! I am excessively sorry. May I—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw the proposal quivering on his lips, and beat
it back ere it was uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, no; you had better call in Dr. Hicks; he
will advise you temporarily. Dr. Murchison will be able
to resume work, I hope, to-morrow. If the case is very
urgent—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Inglis tugged at his gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will send over word,” he said, dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you; you sympathize, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.” And being a nice youth he showed his
consideration by retreating and buttoning his coat up
over his burden of incompetence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physical prostration of a strong man who has
sinned against his body is as nothing to the bitter humiliation
of his soul. Ethical defeat is the most poignant of
all disasters. Like an athlete who has strained heart and
lungs only to be beaten, he feels that anguish of exhaustion,
that miserable sense of impotence, the conviction
that his strength has been of no avail. Spiritual defeat
has its more subtle agonies. In some such overwhelming
of the soul the man may turn his face like Hezekiah to the
wall, and refuse to be comforted because of his own shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Catherine her husband’s awakening anguish had
been pitiable in the extreme. He had lain like one wounded
to the death, refusing to be comforted or to be assured
of hope. Slowly, as she had sat by him and held his hand,
he had told her everything, blurting out the confession
with a sullen yet desperate self-hate. The very pathos of
her trust in him, the divine quickness in her to forgive,
had been as girdles of thorn about his body. What had
he done to justify her love? Disgraced and humiliated
her in this haven of rest her hands had made for him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To appreciate to the full the irony of life, a man has
but to be unfortunate for—perhaps—three days. It
was about four in the afternoon when Catherine, sitting
beside her husband’s bed, heard the unwelcome panting
of the car. The man Gage had driven fast from Boland’s
Farm. He had a letter from Dr. Inglis, an urgent message,
so he had been told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine met him at the gate, and took the letter to
her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A message, dear, from Dr. Inglis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached for it with a hand that trembled, his eyes
faltering from her face. She sat down by the bed, watching
him silently as he tore open the envelope and read
the letter.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Murchison</span>,—Please come over at once, if possible.
Hicks has diagnosed acute internal strangulated
hernia. He has been called off to a midwifery case.
The relatives are getting out of hand. I think an immediate
operation will be necessary. I have been to
Lombard Street, and got the instruments together.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Inglis</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The jerky, straggling sentences betrayed the theorist’s
loss of nerve and self-control. It was evident that the
gentleman with the gilded degrees was in no enviable
panic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him, and touched his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have to go,” he said, sombrely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, but you are not fit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up in bed, looked at her, and gave a wry and
miserable smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had not been such an infernal fool! The last time,
Kate, I swear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught the letter and read it through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inglis is a miserable thing to lean on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t blame the youngster. At least he is sober.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She winced, as though his self-condemnation hurt her,
and surrendering her fortitude of a sudden, broke out
into tears. Murchison looked at her helplessly, feeling
like a man bound and chained by the shame of his own
manhood. He felt himself unworthy to touch her, too
much humiliated even to offer comfort. The very sincerity
of his self-disgust drove him to action. He sprang out
of bed and began to dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine, still sobbing, went to the window and strove
to overcome the shuddering weakness that had seized
her. Her husband’s determination appeared to increase
at the expense of her surrender. It was as though they
had exchanged moods in a moment, and that the wife’s
tears had given the man courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned against the window, and brushed her tears
aside with her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, dear. I was a fool, an accursed fool.
Never again. Trust me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched her arm appealingly, like an awed lover
who fears to offend. Catherine turned her head and
looked at him, her courage shining through her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words hurt me. You called yourself a drunkard.
No, no, you are not that. Oh, my beloved, I need
you now—and you must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arms were round her in an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wife, look up. God help me, I will conquer the curse!
How can I fail, with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never again?—swear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never. It was a trick of the brain, a damned piece
of moral vanity. And I am a man who advises others!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned, and, standing before the glass, pinned on
her hat and threw her dust cloak round her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home, to the children,” and she gave a great sob.
“Mrs. Graham can look after the cottage. You will
want me at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wife, I want you always.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It is the privilege of short-tempered women to wax
testy under the touch of trouble, and Mrs. Baxter, her
hard face querulous and unlovely, stood in the doorway
of Boland’s Farm, watching the road for the flash of the
doctor’s lamps. A couple of cypress-trees, dead and
brown towards the house, built a deep porch above the
door. Beyond the white palings of the garden the broad
roof of a barn swept up against the sombre azure of the
summer night; and the blackness of the byres and outhouses
contrasted with the lawn that was lit by the lighted
windows. To the west stood four great Lombardy poplars
whose leaves made the night breeze seem restless
about the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The austere figure of her sister joined itself to Mrs.
Baxter’s under the cypresses. They talked together in
undertones as they watched the road, their voices harsh
and unmusical even in an attempted whisper. Mrs.
Baxter and Miss Harriet Season were tall and sinewy
women, narrow of face and mind, hard in eye and body,
their sense of sex reduced to insignificance. The unfortunate
Inglis, who sat pulling at his watch-chain beside
Mr. Thomas Baxter’s bed, had found their hawk faces
too keen and uncompromising for his self-esteem. They
had scented out his incompetence as two old crows will
scent out carrion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drat the man, is he never coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter smoothed her dress, and stood listening
irritably, an angular and inelegant silhouette against the
lamp-light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just hear Tom groaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that poor ninny sitting by the bed and trying to
look wise. Ain’t that a light over the willows? I shall
lose my temper if it ain’t Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Harriet tilted her head like an attentive parrot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hear the thing puffing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just keep quiet—can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor, Mary, you are peevish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I listen with all your chattering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison, depressed and out of heart, met these two
ladies at the farm-house door. They greeted him with
no relieved and hysterical profuseness. Mrs. Baxter extended
a red-knuckled hand, looking like a woman ready
to express a grievance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad you’ve come at last, doctor; we’ve been waiting
long enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ushered Murchison into the parlor, a room that
cultivated ugliness from the wool-work mantel-cover to
the red and yellow rug before the door. Murchison, like
most professional men, had become accustomed to the
impertinent petulance of sundry middle-class patients.
Unstrung and inwardly humiliated as he was that night,
the austere woman’s tartness roused his impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My car broke down on the way. How is Mr. Baxter?”
and he pulled off his gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad, sir, sorry to say. I can’t think, doctor, how you
could send that young chap over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Inglis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He don’t know his business; we hadn’t any faith in
him from the minute he entered the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Inglis is perfectly competent to represent me
when I am away from Roxton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, doctor, I beg to differ.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter’s grieved contempt suggested that Murchison
had no Christian right to rest or eat when duty
called him. Had the lady been less selfish and aggressive
she might have been struck by the man’s tired eyes and
nervous, irritable manner. But Mrs. Baxter was one of
those crude and complacent people who never consider
the sensitive complexities of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will see your husband at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’re not going to operate, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s face betrayed his irritation as he moved
towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear madam, do you wish me to attend your husband,
or do you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bony woman tilted her chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t hold with people being cut about with knives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ignorance when insolent is doubly exasperating, and
Murchison was in no mood for an argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Baxter, from what Dr. Hicks has said, your husband
will die unless operated on immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer’s wife shrugged, and pressed her lips together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, doctor, have your own way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I am to attend your husband you must trust in my
opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—of course. Do what you think proper, sir. I
know we don’t signify.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison abandoned Mrs. Baxter to her prejudices,
and climbed the stairs to the bedroom, where Dr. Inglis
dabbled scalpels and artery forceps in surgical trays.
The assistant’s thin face welcomed his superior with a
worried yet grateful smile. No heroine of romance had
listened more eagerly for the sound of her lover’s gallop
than had Dr. Inglis for the panting of Murchison’s car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the bed with its white chintz valance and side curtains
lay the farmer, skin ashy, eyes sunken, the typical
facies of acute abdominal obstruction. A sickly stench
rose from a basin full of brown vomit beside the bed.
The man hiccoughed and groaned as he breathed, each
spasm of the diaphragm drawing a quivering gulp of
pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison, his eyes noting each significant detail,
seated himself on the edge of the bed. He had hoped
that Inglis might have been mistaken, and that he should
find the case less grave than Dr. Hicks had suggested.
Murchison dreaded the thought of an operation, even as
a tired man dreads the duty he cannot justify. He felt
unequal to the nerve strain that the ordeal demanded,
for his hand was not the steady hand of the master for
the night. Slowly and with the uttermost care he examined
the man, realizing with each sign and symptom
that Hicks’s diagnosis appeared too true. There was no
escaping from the gravity of the crisis. Unless relieved,
Thomas Baxter would surely die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison rose with a tired sigh, and pressing his eyes
for a moment with the fingers of his right hand, went to
the table where Inglis had been arranging the instruments
and dressings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have anæsthetics?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Are you going to operate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I must. It is our only chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the bed, it is a regular feather pit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have to put up with these things in the country.
I have performed tracheotomy with a pair of scissors and
a hair-pin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inglis had faith enough in his chief’s resources. True,
Murchison looked fagged and out of fettle, yet the theorist
little suspected how greatly the elder man dreaded what
was before him. Poor Porteus Carmagee’s port had
worked havoc with that delicate marvel, the brain of the
scientific age. Murchison had sustained a moral shock,
and he was still tremulous with humiliation and remorse.
One of the most trying ordeals of surgery lay before him,
with every disadvantage to test his skill. A weaker man
might have temporized, or played the traitor by surrendering
to nature. Murchison’s conscience was too strong
to suffer him to shirk his duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crossed the room to the bed, and bent over the
farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Baxter, you are very ill; we must give you chloroform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s sunken eyes looked up pathetically into
Murchison’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear Lord, doctor, anything; I can’t stand the
gripe of it much longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You understand that I am going to operate on you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, sir, do just what you think proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes the instrument table, with a powerful
electric surgical-lamp, had been brought near the bed.
Murchison had taken off his coat, tied on an apron, and
was soaking his hands in perchloride of mercury. Inglis
had the chloroform mask over the farmer’s face. The
man was weak with the anguish he had suffered, and took
the anæsthetic without a struggle. Soon came the twitching
of the limbs and the incoherent babbling as the vapor
took effect. Murchison gave a rapid glance at the instrument
table to see that everything he needed was to
hand. Then he bared the farmer’s body, packed it round
with towels, and began to scrub and cleanse the skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s nearly under, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison felt Baxter’s pulse, and frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must waste no time,” he remarked, setting back
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pupil reflex has gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep him as lightly under as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the glimmer of a knife, and a long streaking
of the skin with red. Murchison worked rapidly, spreading
the lips of the wound with the fingers of his left hand
while he plied the knife. The patient’s stertorous breathing
seemed to fill the room. Murchison swabbed the
wound briskly, and worked on with grim and quiet
patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon half a dozen artery forceps were dangling about
the wound. Murchison was bending over the farmer,
insinuating his hand into the abdominal cavity. Inglis
glanced at him with a worried air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you feel anything, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like the pulse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must risk it; watch the breathing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s forehead had become full of lines. His
face was the face of a man whose intelligence is strained
to the utmost pitch of sensitiveness. The ordeal of touch,
the education of four finger-tips, stood between failure and
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inglis shot a questioning glance at his chief’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Found anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I must enlarge the wound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knife went to work again, with swabs and artery
forceps to choke the blood flow. Murchison was sweating
as though he had run half a mile under a July sun.
There was an impatient twitching of the muscles of his
face. He breathed fast and deeply, like a man whose
staying power is being taxed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound the man’s fat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inglis smiled feebly but sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not an easy case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait. No, I thought I had something. Look after
the pulse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strain was beginning to tell on Murchison after
the overthrow of the previous night. He looked jaded,
pale, and impatient. The reek of the anæsthetic made
the blood buzz in his temples. At such a time a surgeon
needs superhuman nerve, that iron patience that is never
flustered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minutes passed, and the skilled fingers were still baffled.
Murchison straightened his back with a kind of groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wipe my forehead,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inglis leaned forward, and wiped the sweat away with
a napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” and he went to work again, yet with a
hand that trembled. That supreme self-control had
deserted him for the moment. He seemed feverish and
spasmodic, out of temper with the difficulties of the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil take it! Ah—at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a relieved breath, his eyes brightening, his
face clearing a little. The deft fingers had succeeded,
and swabs and sponges were soon at work. Sweat dropped
from his forehead into the wound, but Murchison
did not heed it in his strained intentness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass me some sponges. Thanks. Count for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More minutes passed before Murchison lifted his head
with a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God, that’s over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I stop the chloroform?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, keep it on a little longer. How many sponges
were there? Six? One, two, three, four, five, and the
last. Now for the ligatures,” and he handled the threads
with quivering fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inglis was feeling the man’s pulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t stand much more, Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, you can stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had the concentration of his mind force relaxed
for him than Murchison felt dizzy in the head, and
saw a luminous fog before his eyes. Sweat ran from him;
the room seemed saturated with the reek of chloroform.
The reaction rushed on him with a feeling of nausea and
a great sense of faintness at the heart. Bandage in hand,
he swayed back, collapsed into a chair, and bent his head
down between his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A decanter of brandy stood on the dressing-table.
Inglis, not a little scared, darted for it, and poured out a
heavy dose into a tumbler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up, Murchison? Here, drink this down.
Baxter’s all right for the moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison lifted a gray face from between his hands
to the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Inglis, I feel done up. Don’t bother about
me. I shall be right again in a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put the brandy aside, and wiped his forehead with
the sleeve of his shirt. Inglis was completing the bandaging
of the wound that Murchison had left unfinished.
The farmer was breathing heavily, a streak of foam blubbering
at his blue and swollen lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better turn home, sir, I can manage now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison rose wearily and went to wash his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be fagged, Inglis,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it,” and the theorist displayed more
courage now that the responsibility was on other shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might stay for an hour or two. I left word in
Roxton for Nurse Sprange to come out. You must put
up with the old ladies’ tongues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The assistant frowned slightly as he recollected Mrs.
Baxter and her sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see them, Murchison, before you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two shallow-chested women were waiting for news
in the hideous parlor. Even Mrs. Baxter’s stupidity
could not ignore the look of distress on Murchison’s face.
By the time the doctors had taken, she guessed that an
operation had been performed, and by Murchison’s manner
that it had not proved successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doctor, bad news, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter was more ready to quarrel than to weep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The operation has been perfectly satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your husband is still in very grave danger, but I see
no reason why he should not recover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison picked his gloves out of his hat. An expressive
glance passed between Mrs. Baxter and her
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dr. Inglis remains in charge. One of the Roxton
nurses will be here any moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer’s wife betrayed her indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, that ninny! He ain’t fit to doctor a cat. I
tell you, Dr. Murchison, I don’t want him in my house.”
The man’s eyes flashed in his tired face. The woman’s
impertinence was insufferable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, madam, Dr. Inglis is perfectly competent to
be left in charge. I shall see your husband early to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter sniffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I call it an insult!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it what you will, my dear woman, but I need
rest—like other people, and I must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And go he did, leaving two sour and quarrelsome faces
at the farm-house door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Lombard Street, Catherine was waiting for her husband
after putting Gwen and Jack to bed. She rose
anxiously at the sound of the car, and met Murchison in
the hall. His face shocked her even in the shaded lamplight.
He looked like a man who had come through some
great travail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, dear—how—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m through with it, thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done—well done. I know how you have suffered.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison slept the sleep of the just that night,
to wake to the golden stillness of a July day. With
the return of consciousness came a feeling of profound
relief as he remembered the ordeal of the preceding evening.
Catherine had risen while he was yet asleep, and
was standing before the pier-glass combing her lambent
hair. Murchison’s eyes had opened to all the familiar
beauty of the room, the delicate touches of color, the
books and pictures, the sunlight shining upon the curtains
with their simple stencilling of scarlet tulips. He
lay still awhile, watching his wife, and the tremulous
glimmer of the golden threads tossed from the sweeping
comb. Catherine had been spared the lot of many of
the married, that casual kindness, that familiar monotony
that smothers all romance. Love is often blessed when
gleaning the fields of sorrow, and the pathos of life is an
inspiration towards poetry. Those who suffer most are
the children of the spirit. Life never loses its mystery
for the idealist, while your <span class='it'>épicier</span> has no stronger joy
than the purchasing of a red-wheeled gig or the building
of some abominable and inflamed-face villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison rose, kissed his wife, and dressed to the
sound of his children laughing and romping in the nursery.
There was something invigorating to him in their noisy
prattle, a breath of the east wind, a glimpse of the sea.
On the landing he met Miss Gwen running to him with
open arms. Murchison seized on the child, and kissed
her, as though God had given him a pledge of honor.
The clean home-life seemed very sweet to him that morning.
He felt strong and sure again, ready to retrieve the
unhappiness of yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day’s first rebuff met him at the breakfast-table
when a rough cart stopped outside the house, and the
maid brought him a dirty note from Boland’s Farm,
with “Immediate” scrawled across the corner of the
envelope. Instinct warned Murchison that it contained
bad news, and Catherine saw the clouding of her husband’s
face as he read the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Baxter is worse, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” and he passed her the note; “it is the species
of case that breeds bad feeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine flushed angrily as she read the letter. It
came from Mrs. Baxter, and was the impertinent production
of a vulgar and half-educated mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an insufferable person. And this is gratitude!
Shall you go, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must. They refuse to see Inglis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s eyes glistened as she returned the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professional men have much to bear,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chiefly the criticism of ignorant people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the ingratitude!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found the good to outweigh the bad,” he said;
“but these cases sadden one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours had passed stormily at Boland’s Farm.
There had been a brisk battle between Mrs. Baxter and
the nurse, before the latter lady had spent sixty minutes
under the farm-house roof, a battle that had originated
in the simple brewing of a basin of beef-tea. The nurse
and the housewife advocated different methods, and the
trivial variation had been sufficient to set the women
quarrelling. Dr. Inglis had intervened in the middle of
the discussion, only to divert Mrs. Baxter’s anger to himself.
She had assured the theorist bluntly that they
needed him no further, and had requested him to inform
Dr. Murchison that the Baxters, of Boland’s Farm,
were not to be insulted by being served by an assistant.
Despite the energy of his wife’s tongue, Thomas Baxter’s
condition had grown markedly worse. The nurse
and the two shrews had watched by him through the night,
their pitiable peevishness unmoved by the sick man’s peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At seven o’clock Nurse Sprange had favored Mrs. Baxter
with her opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse, of course!” the housewife had exclaimed;
“what can any Christian creature expect after the way
they hacked the poor soul about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse had ruffled up in defence of the profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better send at once for Dr. Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think we had. The lad can drive over in
the milk-cart. Murchison did the thing; he’d better
mend it, if he can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison drove through the July fields where the
corn was rustling for the harvest. The cottage gardens
were full of flowers, sweet-pease a-flutter in the sun, the
borders packed with scent and color. On the river’s
bank the willows drooped lazily, and the meadows had
been shorn of their fragrant hay. To the south the pine
woods of Marley Down touched the azure of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His welcome at Boland’s Farm was neither cordial nor
inspiring. Murchison had expected sour faces, and sour
and sinister they were. Mrs. Baxter was a cynic by
choice, one of those women who count their change carefully
to the last farthing as though forever expecting to
be cheated. Her manner towards Murchison was abrupt
and aggressive. She bore herself towards him with a
threatening dourness, as though she held him responsible
for her husband’s critical condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to hear Mr. Baxter is no better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady looked supremely sapient, as though the brilliance
of her genius had foreshadowed the event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I told you, doctor, that I don’t hold with all
this operating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry that we disagree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you will step up-stairs, doctor, and just see
Mr. Baxter for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam’s presence was not enthralling, and Murchison
escaped from her with relief. The ugly parlor, with its
texts and its piety, seemed part and parcel of the world
to which farmer Baxter’s wife belonged. But sick men
cannot be responsible for their wives, and Murchison knew
that Tom Baxter was more sinned against than sinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nurse Sprange was sitting by the patient’s bed, looking
limp and tired, as though her patience had been torn to
tatters by Mrs. Baxter’s restless temper. She rose as
Murchison entered, and drew back the curtains to let
more light into the room. Murchison nodded to her,
and took the chair that she had left. The farmer was
lying very still and straight, his eyes half closed, his breathing
shallow, as though any expansion of the chest gave
him acute pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Baxter, how do you feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man turned his head feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, doctor, not mighty grand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any pain now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pain, sir, plenty; not like the gripe, but just as if I
had a lot of weed-killer sluicing about inside of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Any tenderness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer winced under Murchison’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, doctor, it be damned sore!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All over. What d’you think of me, sir? I guess I’m
pretty bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s eyes were searching Murchison’s face. He
had been a fat and hearty liver, a full-blooded man who
had loved life, where his wife was not, and was loath to
leave it. There was something pathetic in his almost
bovine dread, as though like one of his own oxen he had
an instinct of the end. Murchison pitied him. He had
seen many such men die, some like frightened animals,
others sullen and sturdy against their doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must keep up your pluck, Baxter,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, sir, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow, you are very bad, it is no use shirking
it. I hope yet to see you recover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, doctor, you’ve done your best,” and he
turned his face away with a groan of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison took the nurse out with him to the head of
the stairs, and questioned her as to any symptoms she
had observed during the night. Her evidence only
tended to strengthen the gloomy prognosis he had already
made. Nothing remained for him but to consider Mrs.
Baxter’s unsensitive soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady did not weep. On the contrary, she displayed
gathering resentment, the prejudice of an inferior nature,
and gave Murchison the benefit of her free opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well tell you, doctor, that I’m not satisfied.
If my Tom had had proper attention from the first—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t have had to use that there knife. And
it’s my opinion, sir, that you’ve done more harm than
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s patience was being severely tested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you are quite yourself, Mrs. Baxter,”
he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not myself, indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot hold you responsible for what you are saying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestion of any hysterical weakness on her part
offended the lady more than her husband’s probable decease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, doctor, I’m no fool, and I tell you you’ve
done your business badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear woman, this is absolutely unwarranted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg to differ, sir, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison prevented the imminent insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you care to place the case in other hands, by all
means do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall send for Dr. Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you be afraid of getting your money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a secondary consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I guess not, operations don’t cost twopence-halfpenny.
I’ll send for Steel at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison took his hat and gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Mrs. Baxter, I had better wish you good-morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And being too much of a philosopher to accuse the
lady of ingratitude, he left her in possession of her prejudices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been the season of garden-fêtes at Roxton, when
the gracious gowns of the mesdames and demoiselles
glorified the sleek lawns and herb-scented gardens of the
old town. Gay colors and piquant hats were in July
flower, save for the few sober weeds who put forth no
gaudy corolla to attract the winged messengers of love.
Mrs. Betty had paraded the terraces and yew walks in
dove-colored silk, in crimson, and in lilac. Her successive
sunshades were as so many royal flowers that
came as by magic from the house of glass. She was an
æsthetic spirit, and loved beauty, particularly when the
picture was painted upon the surface of her own pier-glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, delectable as she was with her pale and sinuous
glamour, Mrs. Betty had many rebuffs to remember within
the sound of St. Antonia’s bells. Dull, domesticated
ladies in a country town do not embrace with enthusiasm
a young and fascinating woman who has a habit of drawing
the men about her. Mrs. Betty was regarded as a
dangerous person, a species of Circe who looked sidelong
into the faces of respectable married men, and possessed
a mother-wit and a vivacity that made her seem like
sparkling wine beside the “domestic ditch-water” she
abhorred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine Murchison succeeded with her sister-women
where Betty Steel failed utterly. There was a frankness,
an absolute lack of the guile of the Cleopatra, about her
that set jealous matrons at their ease. She was so notoriously
devoted to her own husband and her home that
the respectable flock welcomed her with pleasant bleatings.
It was this very popularity of hers that impressed
itself on the social pageantries of Roxton. The quick-eyed
Betty saw her rival receive the smiles of the feminine
community, while she herself was favored with polite distrust.
Catherine Murchison was considered orthodox,
and to be orthodox is the first proof of gentility among
genteel people. Mrs. Steel might be stigmatized as something
of a social heretic. And women, being the most
outrageous Tories in their heart of hearts, dreaded the
fascinating and glib-tongued Socialist who would perhaps
reform the marriage laws into free love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence, through all the galaxy of the Roxton garden-parties,
Parker Steel’s wife had accumulated many
incidental grievances against her rival. Women are
sensitive beings, so sensitive that their feelings may be
diffused into a smart gown or a Paris hat. The old battle-fire
burned in Mrs. Betty’s Circassian eyes. She was
amassing her grievances, slowly, surely, and with that
curious secretiveness that has often characterized the
feminine heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thomas Baxter, of Boland’s Farm, is dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel whisked his serviette over his knees, and
looked with a peculiar glint of the eye at his wife in her
orange-silk tea-gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead as Marley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they only turned Murchison out yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. And the dear wife is in the most militant
of tempers, the Puritanical old fraud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s olive skin had flushed. She was breathing
deeply, and her glance had a significant and inspired
glitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spruce physician showed his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You expect more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are teasing me, keeping back some delicate
morsel. Has Murchison blundered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wish seems mother to the thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Baxter has demanded a post-mortem examination.
I am to perform it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife’s lips parted, and closed again into a hard line.
She looked wickedly handsome in her yellow gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall take Brimley, of Cossington, with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. You must have a second opinion, and Brimley
does not love the six-footer. What do you think,
Parker?—tell me frankly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor wiped his mustache, took up his sherry
glass and sipped the wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say—yet,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But supposing—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what am I to suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Murchison blundered badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Steel meditated an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professional etiquette”—he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professional nonsense! If—Parker, you must not
lose a possible chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband regarded her with amused interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would strike your little Italian stiletto into
Murchison’s reputation,” he said.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There is little that is beautiful in death, save, perhaps,
in the faces of children, and those taken in the
heyday of their youth. As in life the majority of mortals
are ugly and grotesque, so in death the body grows in
repulsiveness as it nears the grave. The lily corpse with
the angelic smile is rarely seen, save perhaps by irresponsible
poets. Blotched and stiff, shrunken or inflated, the
nameless thing welcomes putrefaction and decay. Beauty
of outline is lost to the limbs, the bones show at the joints,
the muscles stand out in stiff and unnatural relief. Nothing
but the glamour of sentiment preserves this ruined
tabernacle of the flesh from being designated as a “carcass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Boland’s Farm the house had that sickly and indescribable
smell of death. Farmer Baxter’s bullocks
grazed peacefully in the great fourteen-acre lot to the east
of the garden; the hens clucked and scratched in the rickyard;
the pigs sucked and paddled in the swill. The laborers
were at work as though their master was still alive
to curse them across fields and hedgerows. The soil pays
no heed to death; it is a natural occurrence; only we human
beings elevate it into an incident of singularity and
note. The farm-hands who passed through the yard cast
curious and awed looks at the darkened windows of the
house. Mrs. Baxter had given them their orders, and
they knew there would be no shirking where that lady
was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of traps were standing before the garden gate,
and in the death-chamber two intent figures bent over
the bed that had been drawn close to the open window.
The sun shone upon the body, a mere mountain of flesh,
loathsome, gaping, flatulent, lying naked from loins to
chin. In death this carcass seemed to dishonor all the
higher aspirations of the race. A myriad organisms were
usurping the tissues that had worked the will of what
men call “the soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Brimley, of Cossington, a little, spectacled cherub
of a man, held back the yellow flaps of fat-laden skin
while his confrère groped and delved within the cavity.
There was a wrinkle of disgust about Parker Steel’s sharp
mouth. He had never vanquished that loathing of contact
with the nauseous slime of death. The cold and succulent
smoothness of the inert tissues repelled his cultured
instincts. Yet even the superfine sneer vanished from
about his nostrils as he drew out a black and oozing object
from the dead man’s body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, Brimley, look at this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spectacled cherub peered at it, puckered up his
lips and gave a whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sponge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice mess, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Relieved that I haven’t the responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel’s delicate hands were at work again. A sharp
exclamation of surprise escaped him as he drew out a
pair of artery forceps, and held them up to Brimley’s
gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a pretty business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Brimley’s eyes seemed to enlarge behind his spectacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confoundedly unpleasant for the operator. The man
must have lost his head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put your hand in here,” and Parker Steel guided his
confrère’s fingers into the cavity, “tell me what you feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brimley groped a moment, and then elevated his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord!—what was Murchison at? A rent in the
bowel three inches long!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better have a look at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the evidence of the sense of vision confirmed the
evidence of the sense of touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both men perched themselves on the bed, and looked
questioningly into each other’s eyes. Success demands
the survival of the fittest, and in the scramble for gold
and reputation men may ignore generosity for egotistical
and self-serving cant. Parker Steel did not determine to
act against his rival, without a struggle. He remembered
his wife’s words, and they decided him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel looked Dr. Brimley straight in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only one thing to be done,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no personal grudge against Murchison, but
before God, Brimley, I can’t forgive him this abominable
bungling. Professional feeling or no, I can’t stretch my
conscience to such a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Brimley stared and nodded. He was somewhat
impressed by Steel’s cultured indignation, a professional
Brutus waxing public-spirited over Cæsar’s body. Moreover,
he was no friend of Murchison’s, and was secretly
pleased to hear another man assume the moral responsibility
of injuring his reputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you will tell the old lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take it to be a matter of duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so; I agree with you, Steel. But it will about
smash Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel moved to the wash-stand and began to
rinse his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot see how I can give a death certificate,” he
said; “the man must have been drunk. It is a case for
the coroner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Brimley puckered his chubby mouth and whistled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no other conclusion to accept,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter was awaiting the two gentlemen in the
darkened parlor, dressed in her black silk Sabbath gown.
She had a photograph-album on her knee, and was chastening
her grief by referring to the faded pictures of the past.
Each photograph stood for a season in the late farmer’s
life. Tom Baxter as a fat and plethoric-looking youth
of twenty, in a braided coat and baggy trousers, one hand
on a card-board sundial, the other stuffed into a side-pocket.
Tom Baxter, ten years later, in his Yeomanry uniform,
mustachioed, tight-thighed, nursing a carbine, with an
air of assertive self-satisfaction. Tom Baxter and his
bride awkwardly linked together arm in arm, toes out,
top hat and bridal bouquet much in evidence. Tom
Baxter, fat, prosperous, and middle-aged, smoking his
pipe in a corner of the orchard, his Irish terrier at his
feet; a snapshot by a friend. The widow studied them
all with solemn deliberation, glancing a little scornfully
at her sister Harriet, who was snivelling over a copy of
Eliza Cook’s poems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard the voices of the two doctors above, the
sound of a door opening, and footsteps descending the
stairs. Parker Steel, suave, quiet, and serious as a black
cat, appeared at the parlor door. Mrs. Baxter rose from
her chair, and signalled to her sister to leave her with
Parker Steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harriet, go out. Sit down, doctor,” and she replaced
the album on its pink wool mat in the middle of the circular
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet absented herself without a murmur, Miss Cook’s
volume still clasped in her bony fingers. From the direction
of the stables came the plaintive howling of a dog,
Tom Baxter’s Irish terrier, Peter, who had been chained
up because he would haunt the landing outside his dead
master’s room. Mrs. Baxter had fallen over the poor
beast as he crouched at the top of the stairs, and poor
Peter’s loyalty had not saved him from chastisement
with the lady’s slipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel seated himself on the extreme edge of an
arm-chair, a great yellow sunflower in a Turkish-red
antimacassar haloing him like a saint. He had assumed
an air of studied yet anxious reserve, as though the matter
in hand required delicate handling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doctor, it’s all over, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel nodded, hearing Miss Harriet’s voice in the
distance rasping out endearments to the dead man’s
dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Brimley and I have completed the examination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Tom! poor Tom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can sympathize with you, Mrs. Baxter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, doctor. How that dog do howl, to be
sure! And now, sir, let’s come to business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow sat erect and rigid in her chair, her hands
clasped in her lap, an expression of determined alertness
on her face. Steel, student of human nature that he
was, felt relieved that it was Murchison and not he
who had incurred the resentment of this hard-fibred
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you be so good as to tell me, doctor, just what
my husband died of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel fidgeted, and studied his finger-nails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is rather painful to me,” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Painful, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To have to confess to a brother-doctor’s misman—misdirection
of the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tactful disinclination reacted electrically upon Mrs.
Baxter. She leaned forward in her chair, and brandished
a long forefinger with exultant solemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I thought, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel cleared his throat and proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You understand my professional predicament, Mrs.
Baxter. At the same time, I feel it to be my duty—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just you tell me the plain facts, doctor; what did my
husband die of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel rose from his chair, walked to the window, and
stood there a moment looking out into the garden, as
though struggling with the ethics and the etiquette of the
case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frankly, Mrs. Baxter,” and he turned to her with a
grieved air, “I am compelled to admit that this operation
hastened your husband’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter bumped in her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor, I could have sworn it. Go on, I can bear
the scandal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Murchison made a very grave mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sponge and a pair of artery forceps were left in
your husband’s body. As for the operation, well, the less
said of it the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Baxter rose and went to the mantel-shelf, and taking
down a bottle of smelling-salts, applied them deliberately
to either nostril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then this man Murchison killed my husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel gave an apologetic shrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to state facts,” he explained. “I cannot swear
to what might have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the ‘might have’ alone, doctor. I’ve pulled the
pease out of the pod, and by the Holy Spirit I’ll boil my
water in Murchison’s pot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel attempted to pacify her, confident in his
heart that any such effort would be useless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Baxter, let me explain to you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Explain! What is there to explain? This man’s
killed my husband. I’ll sue him, I’ll make him pay for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, one word—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow raised her hands and patted Steel solemnly
on the shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve done your duty by me, doctor, for I reckon
it isn’t proper to tell tales of the profession. Now, listen,
I’ll relate what Jane Baxter’s going to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel’s silence welcomed the confession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m going to order the market-trap out, the
trap my poor Tom used to drive in to Roxton every Monday,
the Lord have pity on him!—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going straight to call at Lawyer Cranston’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And just set him to pull Dr. Murchison’s coat from
off his back.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dance that night at one of the Roxton
houses, and Mrs. Betty, brilliant in cream and carnation,
swept through the room with all the verve of a
girl of twenty. Her partners discovered her in wondrous
fettle—swift, splendid, and audacious, color in her cheeks,
a sparkle of conscious triumph in her eyes. Her tongue
was in sympathy with the quickness of her feet. She
prattled, laughed, and was as deliciously impertinent as
any minx who has a theory of fascination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hamilton-Hamilton, the hostess of the night, was
a patient of James Murchison’s, and Catherine’s more
gracious comeliness came as a contrast to Mrs. Betty’s
faylike glamour. The Hamiltons were brewers, wealthy
plebeians who had assimilated that lowest of all arts, the
art of making money, without absorbing a culture that
was of the same temper as their gold. Catherine had
left her husband to his pipe and his books at Lombard
Street. She had come to serve him, because as a doctor’s
wife she knew the value of smart publicity. In small
towns trifles are of serious moment. Orthodoxy is in the
ascendant, and individual singularity of opinion is considered
to be “peculiar.” A professional gentleman
suspected of free thought may discover his social standing
being damaged by the vicaress behind his back.
Bigotry dies hard despite the broadening of our culture,
and “eccentric” individuals may be ostracized by the
sectarians of a town. Forms and formularies produce
hypocrites. It is perilous for professional gentlemen to
appear eccentric. Even if they abstain from lip service
in person, their wives must be regular in helping to populate
the parish pews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate Murchison and Mrs. Betty passed and repassed
each other in the vortex of many a waltz. To Parker
Steel’s wife there was a prophetic triumph on the wind.
She found herself calculating, as she chatted to her partners,
how long these people would remain loyal to the surgeon
of Lombard Street when his repute was damaged
by the scandal at Boland’s Farm. Catherine had a
peculiar interest for her that night, for Mrs. Betty’s hate
was tempered by exultation. She watched for the passing
and repassing of Catherine’s aureole of shimmering
hair, smiling to herself at the woman’s happy ignorance
of the notoriety that threatened her husband’s name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Catherine also, with each sweep of the dance, came
that olive-skinned and complacent face, whose eyes
seemed ever on the watch for her. She caught the rattle
of the dark woman’s persiflage as she drifted past to
the moan of the violins. She remarked an exaggerated
vivacity in Mrs. Betty’s manner, a something that suggested
triumph with each nearness of their faces. Always
the slightly cynical smile, the teeth glimmering between
the lips; always that curious flash of the eyes, sudden and
momentary, like the flash of a light over the night sea.
With women the vaguest of emotions lead to intuitive
gleams of thought, and Mrs. Betty’s exultation inspired
Catherine with reasonless unrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women met in the doorway of the supper-room,
Parker Steel’s wife on Mr. Cranston’s arm, Catherine
escorted by Captain Hensley, of the Buffs. Their
eyes met with a glitter of defiance and distrust. Catherine
would have drawn aside, but Betty, with a laugh,
gave her a pretty sweep of the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seniores priores, dear. How is your husband? What
a delicious evening!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The presentiment of treachery asserted itself with superstitious
strangeness. Catherine colored, stung, despite
herself, by Parker Steel’s wife’s patronizing drawl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. My husband is very well. Has he been
ill?” and the ironical question conveyed a challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s lips parted over their perfect teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cranston is such an enthusiast that I must not
lose him the next waltz. Try the pâté de foie gras, it is
excellent,” and she swept out, with a glitter of amusement,
on the lawyer’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were soon moving in the midst of the music, a
score of rustling dresses swinging their colors over the
polished floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mrs. Murchison,” and the lawyer looked curiously
into his partner’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange that we should have met her, just then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After our discussion at supper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; she knows nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Steel, the penny-post carries more
poison than the rings of the old Italians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then we are more civilized in our methods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly. The cruelties of civilization are more refined,
of the soul rather than of the body. Shall we reverse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. There are some fatalities that cannot be reversed,
Mr. Cranston, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine returned to the great house in Lombard
Street that night with a vague feeling of melancholy and
unrest. She was beginning to know the terror of a secret
in a house, a hidden shame to be held sacred from the
eyes of the world. Nor was it that she did not trust her
husband, nor respect his strength, for few men would
have fought as he had fought, and even in defeat she beheld
a pathos that was wholly tragic, never sordid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was haunted by the thought that night that Betty
Steel had guessed her secret, and only women know the
feline cruelty of their sex. The greater part of the social
snobberies and tyrannies of life are inspired by the spiteful
egotism of women. Catherine knew enough of Betty’s
nature to forecast the mercy she might expect from her
rival’s tongue. Moreover, the very home-coming from
the dance recalled to her that March night when she had
first uncovered her husband’s shame. There are some
memories that are like aggressive weeds, no tearing up
by the roots can banish them from the human heart.
Their tendrils creep and thrust into every crevice of the
mind. Their fruit is full of a poisoned juice, their flowers
red as hyssop—for all the world to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the sake of irony, the letters that Betty Steel and
Mr. Cranston had discussed, were opened by Murchison
at the breakfast-table before the faces of his children and
his wife. Master Jack had been clamoring to be taken
to the cottage on Marley Down, and Gwen had crept
round to her father’s elbow to overpersuade him with
the winsomeness of childhood. The first letter that Murchison
opened was from Cranston; the second from Parker
Steel. Miss Gwen, doll in hand, stood unheeded at her
father’s elbow. It was Catherine who rose, called the
two children, and took them out into the garden to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They clung, one to either hand, the boy prancing and
chattering, the girl solemn-eyed because of her father’s
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, when may we go to Marley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon, dear, soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, do they keep rabbits there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will daddy come too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine disentangled herself, and left them on the
lawn under the great plane-tree, her heart heavy with
some half-expected dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy will come too, dear. I will call you when
you are to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was still sitting at the breakfast-table when
she returned, looking like a man who had lost his all at
cards. His figure appeared shrunken, and hollow at the
shoulders, his face expressionless as though from some
sudden palsy of the brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started as though he had not heard her enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The children, where—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the garden. Tell me, what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happened? My God, Kate, see, read!—what have I
done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out her hand, her face piteously brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steel. There is to be an inquest at Boland’s Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine read it, and the lawyer’s also, an angry glow
welling up into her eyes. She crumpled the letters in her
hand, and stood silent a moment, with quivering lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now—I know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison stared at her like one half-dazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have read it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. A blunder! No, I’ll not believe it, James; there
is malice here. I read it in Betty Steel’s eyes last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the facts,” and he groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Facts! Are they facts? Is Parker Steel infallible?
Wait, I know what I will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s eyes watched her like the eyes of a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will see Dr. Parker Steel. I will ask him by what
right he has dared to act as he has acted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words seemed to shake her husband from his stupor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate, you cannot do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg a favor of that fop! Besides, the case has gone
too far. The facts are there. I blundered. I knew that
I had lost my nerve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a woman’s pity, her pride and
her love still strong and heroic in their trust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not you, dear—not you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I, Kate, but my baser self. Fate takes us when
we are in the toils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard the children in the garden, their laughter
close beneath the window. Murchison’s hands caught the
arms of his chair. His children’s happiness seemed part
of the mockery of fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let them come in. I can’t bear it. I—” and
he broke down suddenly into that most pitiful and tragic
pass when a strong man’s anguish brings him even to
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine, her face transfigured, bent over him, and
seized his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not that! Why, we are here together, and you
look on the darker side—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tears were on her hands; he was ashamed, and hung
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate, it is true, I feel it. Steel—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is too cold a man to risk what he cannot prove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew her breath, and kissed him, the kiss of a
mother and a wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go to him,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not to plead. I could not plead with such a man
as Steel.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel was compiling his list of visits for
the day, when, following the sharp “burr” of the
electric bell, came the announcement that Mrs. Murchison,
of Lombard Street, waited to see him in the drawing-room.
A momentary cloud of annoyance passed over
the physician’s sleek and shallow face. Few men care to
appear ungenerous in the eyes of a woman, and Parker
Steel was not devoid of the passion for indiscriminate
popularity. The craving to appear excellent in the eyes
of others is a more potent power for the polishing of man’s
character than the dogmatics of a state religion, and Mrs.
Betty’s husband purred like a cat about the silk skirts
of society. Man for man, he could have dealt with Murchison
on hard and scientific lines, but with a woman the
logic of unsympathetic facts could be consumed by the
lava flow of the more passionate privileges of the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He continued scribbling at his desk, mentally considering
the attitude he should assume, and hesitating between
an air of infinite regret and a calm assumption of stoical
responsibility. The door opened on him as he still studied
his part. Mrs. Betty stood on the threshold, eyes a-glitter,
an eager frown on her pale face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She closed the door and approached her husband,
leaning the palms of her hands on the edge of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Parker, are you prepared with sal-volatile and
a dozen handkerchiefs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel looked uneasy, a betrayal of weakness that his
wife’s sharp eyes did not disregard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I must see the woman,” and he fastened the
elastic band about his visiting-book with an irritable snap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See her? By all means, unless you are afraid of
needing a tear bottle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you would prefer to interview—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flash of malicious amusement beaconed out from his
wife’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, sir, you must assume the responsibility. I
shall enjoy myself by listening to your diplomatic irrelevances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel pushed back his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, you are a woman, what do you advise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Advise!” and she laughed with delicious satisfaction.
“Am I to advise infallible man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know the tricks of the sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I, indeed! Firstly, then, my dear Parker, beware
of tears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician gave an impatient twist to his mustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate Murchison is not that sort of creature,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, perhaps not. But you may find her dangerous
if she makes use of her emotions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it, Betty, I hate scenes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scenes are easily avoided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By a process of refrigeration. Be as ice. Do not
give the lady an opportunity to melt. Compel her to restrain
herself for the sake of her self-respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel smiled ironically at his wife’s earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An antagonistic attitude—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Polite north-windedness. Be an iceberg
of professional propriety. Kate Murchison has pride;
she will not catch you by the knees. Heavens, Parker”—and
she brimmed with mischief—“I should like to see you
trying to disentangle your legs from some hysterical lady’s
embraces!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband glanced at himself in the glass, and adjusted
his tie as a protest against his wife’s raillery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sooner the interview is ended—the better,” he
remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, let me see you attempt the necessary stony
stare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she glided up and kissed him, much to the spruce
physician’s sincere surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had been moving restlessly to and fro in the
drawing-room, glancing at the photographs and pictures,
and listening to the murmur of voices that reached her
from Parker Steel’s consulting-room. The air of the
house seemed oppressive to her, and there was even an
unwelcome strangeness about the furniture, as though
the inanimate things could conspire against her and repel
her sympathies. The environment was the environment
of an unfamiliar spirit. The personality of the possessor
impresses itself upon the home, and to Catherine
there seemed superciliousness and a sense of antagonism
in every corner. Her woman’s pride put on the armor of
a warlike tenderness. She thought of her children, and
was caught thinking of them by Parker Steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning, Mrs. Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a questioning pause. Catherine remained
standing, her eyes studying the man’s smooth, clever,
but soulless face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come, Dr. Steel, half as a friend—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician’s smile completed the inimical portion
of the sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot but regret,” and he rested his white and
manicured hands on the back of a Chippendale chair,
“that you have thought fit to interview me, Mrs. Murchison,
on such a matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine watched his face as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you realize—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nature of the case? I realize it, Mrs. Murchison,
too gravely to admit this meeting to be a pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chilly suavity reacted on Catherine as Betty Steel
had promised. Individual antipathy comes quickly to
the surface. Any display of feeling before Parker Steel
would have been like throwing a burning torch down
into the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presume you realize the nature of the responsibility
you are assuming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tone had nothing of pacification or appeal. The
curve of her neck became the more haughty as she realized
the purpose of the man to whom she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my responsibility, Mrs. Murchison,” and he
bent his slim and black-sheathed figure slightly over the
rail of the chair, “that makes this interview the more
painful to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have accused my husband of gross incompetence
and carelessness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have stated facts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Murchison’s surgical experience is not that of a
mere theorist. It has an established reputation. You
understand me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel understood her perfectly, his nostrils lifting
at the rebuff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My duty, Mrs. Murchison, is towards my own conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not deny your sense of duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the facts of the case—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say—rather—your interpretation of those facts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For in the interpretation lies the meaning of your
action. I can only warn you, for your own sake, to be
careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s mask of unsympathetic suavity lost its
unflurried coldness for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Murchison, I have my day’s work before
me, and I am a busy man. It is my misfortune to
have earned your resentment by the discovery of a blunder.
Please consider the question to be beyond our individual
interests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am to understand—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I have already adopted the only course that
seemed honest to me. I have declined to give a death
certificate and I have communicated with the coroner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine took the blow without flinching, though a
deep resentment stirred in her as she remembered how
her husband had bulwarked Parker Steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I think there is nothing more to be said between
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician made a step towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accept my regrets”—the vanity of the man, the desire
to stand well in the eyes of a handsome woman, was not
wholly to be suppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I accept no regrets, Dr. Steel—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For no regrets are given. My eyes are open to the
truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel turned the handle of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sense of duty makes us enemies, Mrs. Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, sir, your very lively sense of duty may lead
you some day into a lane that has no turning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether by chance, or by premeditated malice, Mrs.
Betty crossed the hall as Catherine left the drawing-room.
She halted, smiled, and extended a languid hand. Her
eyes recalled to Catherine the eyes of the previous night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, good-morning, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a quiver of emotion on Catherine Murchison’s
face. She looked at Mrs. Betty as she would
have looked at some pert shop-girl who assured her that
some warranted material had been ruined by chemicals
in the wash. Parker Steel’s wife was deprived of any
suggestion of a triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you are not tired after Mr. Cranston’s enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Intelligent partners never tire me. May I echo the
inquiry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her feline spite marred the perfection of Mrs. Betty’s
patronizing pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many thanks. You will excuse me, since I am a
woman with responsibilities. You have no children to
act as mother to, Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barren woman’s lips tightened. The words, with
all their innocent irony, went home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I detest children. All the philosophers will tell
you that they are a doubtful blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of temperament, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us resemble rabbits, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their mutual courtesy had reached the limit of extreme
tension. Parker Steel, who had been watching the lightning
flashes, the play between positive clouds and negative
earth, opened the door to let the imminent storm disperse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine passed out with a slight bending of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful these July days are!” she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Superb,” and Steel took leave of her with a cynical
smile.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s lips were tightly set as she turned
from the shadows of St. Antonia’s elms, where the
sunlight made a moving fret of gold upon the grass. The
sky was a broad canopy of blue above the town, the wooded
hills about it far and faint with haze. To Catherine
the summer stillness of the place, the dim blazoned windows
of the church, the wreathing smoke, the circling
pigeons, were parts of a quaint and homely tenderness
that made her realize the more the repellent coldness of
the house she had just left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had come by one conviction through her visit, the
conviction that those two intellectualists hungered to
humiliate her and her husband. Mrs. Betty’s eyes had
betrayed too much. She would be content with nothing
but sensational head-lines, and the discussion of “the
scandal” in every Roxton home. The brain behind that
ethereal yet supercilious face knew no flush of feeling for
a rival in distress. The pair were exulting over the chance
James Murchison had given them, and the wife had realized
it with a bitter flooding up of loyalty and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had made her plans before she reached the
glare of Lombard Street. She had left her husband sitting
in the darkened room, the blinds drawn down over
his humiliation and self-shame. Her heart grieved in her
for the strong man whose sensitive consciousness had been
paralyzed by the realization of his own irrevocable blunder.
Her pity left him undisturbed, like a sick man needing
rest. Inglis had taken the work for the whole day, for
Catherine had interviewed him in the surgery, and shocked
the theorist by imparting a portion of the truth to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Incredible!” had been Mr. Inglis’s solitary remark,
and Catherine’s heart had blessed him for that single
adjective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she passed the house in Lombard Street, her face
seemed overshadowed for the moment by the unpropitious
heaviness of her thoughts. The vision of her
husband’s pale and troubled face saddened her more utterly
than any regretfulness her pride might feel. Nor
did she pass her home unchallenged, for at the barred
but open window of the nursery, a ripple of gold in the
sunlight bathed her daughter Gwen’s round face,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muvver, muvver!” and a doll’s red pelisse was waved
over the window-sill. Catherine felt all her womanhood
yearn longingly towards the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muvver. I’ve spelled a whole page. Daddy’s gone
out. May I come wid you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine shook her head, her eyes very bright with
tenderness under her blue sunshade. How little the
child realized the grim beneathness of life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, no. I shall be back soon. Ask Mary to
take you for a walk in the meadows,” and she passed on
with a lingering look at the red pelisse and the golden
curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee, white as to waistcoat, brown as to
face, jumped up briskly from his well-worn leather chair
when his head clerk announced Mrs. Catherine Murchison.
The lawyer, despite his eccentricities, was a keen
and tenacious man of business, the emphasis of whose
advice might have impressed an audience more cynical
than the English House of Commons. He had a habit
of snapping at his syllables with a vindictive sincerity that
stimulated nervous clients suffering from the neurasthenia
of indecision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!—a professional visit? My dear Kate, this is a
most portentous event; all my musty deeds must blush
into new pink tape. Sit down. Do you want damages
against your washerwoman for spoiling the underlinen?
Believe me—I have been asked to advise on such questions.
Ah, and how did your husband like my port?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An inward shudder swept through Catherine. The
memories of that night at Marley Down were brutally
vivid to her, like the bizarre dreams of a feverish sleep
remembered in the morning. Porteus had been the
innocent cause of all this misery. Tell him she could not,
that his very kindness had brought her husband to the
brink of ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to have thanked you”—and the words clung
to her throat. “James has had one of his attacks of
nervous depression and an endless amount of worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee’s keen brown eyes sparkled with
intentness as he watched her face. She looked white,
uneasy, haggard about the mouth, like one who has suffered
from the strain of perpetual self-repression. Catherine
had always moved before him as a serene being,
a woman whose face had symbolized the quiet splendor
of an evening sky. He had often quoted her as one of
the few people in the world whose happiness displayed
itself in the beauty of radiant repose. The stain of suffering
on her face was new to him, and the more remarkable
for that same reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak of worries, Kate. Am I to be concerned
in them as a fatherly friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to give him one of her happy smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see—I have to run to you—because I am in
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pathetic simplicity of her manner touched him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Kate,” and his voice lost its usual snappishness,
“how can I serve you—as a friend? It is not
usual to see you worried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know James has been overworked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I not lectured the rogue on a dozen different
occasions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, I know; and he was ill at Marley Down on
Sunday, in the little place where I had hoped to give him
rest. Oh, Porteus, how brutal the responsibilities of
life can be at times! Inglis, our assistant, sent for him
to attend a serious case. James’s sense of duty dragged
him away from Marley. He went, braved a critical
operation, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faltered, her face aglow, as though the very loyalty
of her love made the confession partake of treachery.
The wrinkles about Porteus Carmagee’s eyes seemed to
grow more marked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And made a mess of it, Kate, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brusquerie passed with her as a characteristic
method of concealing emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh!” and he jerked one leg over the chair; “confound
his sense of duty, risking his reputation to ease some old
woman’s temper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine looked at him with a quivering of the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Porteus, you can’t blame him. It seems hard that
one slip may undermine so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ‘undermine’?—why ‘undermine’? The law
does not expect infallibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know—but then—the man died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? What man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farmer Baxter, of Boland’s Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fool who has been eating himself to death for
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine spread her open hands with the look of a
pathetic partisan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James was not in a fit state to meet the strain. The
wife quarrelled with him after the operation, and refused
to let him continue the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, inferior females always quarrel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we have enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So had the saints, and plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Parker Steel—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee sat up briskly in his chair, his
wrinkled face twitching with intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we are growing vital. Well, I can forecast that
gentleman’s procedure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steel was called in, and the man died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most natural of mortals!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He performed a post-mortem with Dr. Brimley, of
Cossington, at the widow’s request. As a result he has
refused to give a death certificate and has written to the
coroner. And Mrs. Baxter has instructed Cranston to
institute an action against us for malpraxis and incompetence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee sat motionless for a moment, his
legs tucked under his chair, his brown face suggestive of
the ugliness of some carved mediæval corbel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I flatter myself that I recognize the inspiring spirit,
Kate,” he said, at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the lady; we have learned to respect our capabilities,
Mrs. Betty—and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed his chair back, established himself on the
hearth-rug, and began the habitual rattling of his bunch
of keys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Kate, you want me to act for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I will? My dear girl, don’t insult my affection for
you all. I must confess that I like to feel vindictive
when I undertake a case. No city dinner could have
made me more irritable, vulpine, and liverish in your
service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s eyes thanked him sufficiently, but they
were still brimming with questioning unrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Porteus, tell me what you think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Kate, don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I help worrying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brown and intelligent face, like the face of a sharp
and keen-eyed dog, lit up with a peculiar flash of tenderness
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Kate, I am not a full-blooded optimist, as you
know, but your woman’s nature makes the affair seem
more serious than it is. Your husband was overworked,
and ill at the time, yet these people insisted—I take it—on
his assuming the full responsibility of the case. Steel
is notoriously an unprincipled rival; as for Brimley, of
Cossington, the fellow is known as the most saintly humbug
as ever made ginger and water appear as potent as
the elixir vitæ. My dear Kate, I know more of the secret
squabbles of this town than you do. People have threatened
to sue Parker Steel before now—yes, in this very
room. If spite and spleen are dragged into the case, I
think I can promise our opponents a somewhat stormy
season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of relief melted into Catherine’s eyes. Porteus
Carmagee was emphatic, and women look for emphasis
in the advice of a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are doing me good, Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. The law is a crabbed old spinster,
but she can be exhilarating on occasions. Tell me, when
did you receive the challenge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This morning, by letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker Steel and Mr. Cranston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. And your husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faltered, and looked aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James was deeply shocked by the thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—of course. He is a man with a conscience.
What is he doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left him at home—to rest. I ought to tell you,
Porteus, that I have seen Parker Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unwise, Kate, unwise. I hope—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and she flushed, hotly; “I made no pretence of
weakness. They had defiance from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good girl—good girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are bitter against us. It was easy to discover
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee drew out his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In an hour, Kate, I will run over and see your husband.
Oblige me by telling him not to look worried.
Now, my dear girl, nonsense, you needn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had risen, and had put her hands upon his
shoulders. And on that single and momentous occasion,
Porteus Carmagee blushed as his bachelor face was
touched by the lips of June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words of a friend in the dry season of trouble are
like dew to the parched grass. Catherine left Porteus
Carmagee’s office with a feeling of gratitude and relief,
as though the sharing of her burden with him had eased
her heart. From a feeling of forlorn impatience she
sprang to a more sanguine and happy temper, with her
gloomier forebodings left among the deeds and documents
of the dusty office. She thought of her husband and her
children without that wistful stirring of regret, that fear
lest some store of evil were being laid up for them in the
home she loved. Her reprieve was but momentary, had
she but known it, for the cup of her humiliation was not
full to the brim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she turned into Lombard Street, she came upon her
two children returning with Mary from a ramble in the
meadows. The youngsters raced for her, eyes aglow,
health and the beauty thereof in every limb. The omen
seemed propitious, the incident as sacred as Catherine
could have wished. Perhaps to the two children her
kisses seemed no less warm and heart-given than of yore,
but to the mother the moment had a meaning that no
earthly poetry could portray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—my darlings—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you been, muvver—where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Uncle Porteus’s. Mary, run around to Arnsbury’s
and ask him to send me in some fruit. I will take the
children home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary departed, leaving youth clinging to the maternal
hands. Master Jack Murchison pranced like a war-horse,
his curiosity still cantering towards Marley Down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, mother, when are we going to the cottage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saturday, dear, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy said we might have tea in the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys who put pepper on the cat’s nose don’t deserve
picnics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Jack giggled over the originality of the crime.
“Old Tom did sneeze!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You was velly cruel, Jack,” and Gwen’s face reproved
him round her mother’s skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little girls don’t know nuffin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can spell ‘fuchsia,’ I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of spelling! Any one can spell—can’t
they, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear,” and the mother laughed; “many people
are not as far advanced as Gwen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were within twenty yards of the great house in
Lombard Street, with its warm red walls and its white
window frames, when a crowd of small boys came scattering
round the northeast corner of St. Antonia’s Square.
In the middle of the road a butcher had stopped his cart,
and several people were loitering by the railings under
the elms, watching something that was as yet invisible to
Catherine and the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I specs it’s Punch and Judy,” and Master Jack tugged
at his mother’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, dear, wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muvver, may I give the Toby dog a biscuit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two, Gwen, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just love to see old Punch smack silly old Judy with
a stick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, you are velly cruel,” and the little lady disassociated
herself once more from all sympathy with her
brother’s barbaric inclinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man turned the corner of the street suddenly, cannoned
two small boys aside, and hurried on with the half-scared
look of one who has seen a child crushed to death
under a cart. He stopped abruptly when he saw Catherine
and the children, his white and resolute face glistening
with sweat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Murchison, take the children in—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine stared at him; it was John Reynolds, her
husband’s dispenser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it—what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man glanced backward over his right shoulder
as though he had been followed by a ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Murchison was taken ill at the County Club.
They sent round for me. Good God, ma’am, get the
children out of the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Catherine stood motionless with the sun
blazing upon her face, her eyes fixed upon a knot of figures
dimly seen under the shadows of the mighty elms. A
great shudder passed through her body. She stooped,
caught up Gwen, and carried the wondering child into
the house. Reynolds, the dispenser, followed with the
boy, who rebelled strenuously, his querulous innocence
making the tragedy more poignant and pathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up, silly old Reynolds—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Master Jack,” and the man panted; “be
quiet, sir. Mrs. Murchison, I must—you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine, her face wonderful in its white restraint,
her eyes full of the horror of keen consciousness, hurried
the two children up the stairs. Outside in the sunlit
street the club porter and a laboring man were swaying
along with an unsteady figure grappled by either arm.
The troop of small boys sneaked along the sidewalk, and
on the opposite pavement some dozen spectators watched
the affair incredulously across the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dang me if it ain’t the doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Jim Murchison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drunk as blazes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little widow woman in black slipped away with a
shudder from the coarse voices of the men. “How horrible!”
And she looked ready to weep, for she was one
of Murchison’s patients and had known much kindness
at his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Reynolds had gone to help the two men get
Murchison up the steps into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, sir,” he said, “pull yourself together!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lemme go, R’nolds, I can walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, sir, steady! For the love of your good lady,
get inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And between them they half carried him into the
house, three men awed by a strong man’s shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had locked the two children into the nursery.
She stood on the stairs, and saw the limp figure of her husband
lifted across the hall into his consulting-room. It was
as though fate had given her the last most bitter draught
to drink. Their cause was lost. She felt it to be the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reynolds, the dispenser, came to her across the hall.
The man was almost weeping, so bitterly did he feel the
misery of it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I have sent for Dr. Inglis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Reynolds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for God’s sake, do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other two men came out from the consulting-room,
and crossed the hall sheepishly, without looking at Catherine.
She turned, and reascended the stairs, leaving to
Reynolds the task of watching by her husband. The
sound of a small fist beating on the nursery door seemed
to echo the loud throbbing of her heart. She steadied
herself, choked back her anguish, unlocked the door, and
went in to her children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muvver, muvver!” Gwen’s eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, darling, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is daddy ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy—daddy is ill,” and she took the two frightened
children in her arms, and wept.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>By certain scientific thinkers life is held to be but a
relative term, and the “definitions” of the ancients
have been cast aside into the very dust that they despised
as gross and utterly inanimate. Whether radium be
“alive” or no, the thing we ordinary mortals know as
“life” shows even in its social aspects a significant sympathy
with the Spencerian definition. The successful
men are those who react and respond most readily, and
most selfishly to the externals of existence. Vulgarly, we
call it the seizing of opportunities, though the clever merchant
may react almost unconsciously and yet instinctively
to the market of the public mind. All life is an adjustment
of relationships, of husband to wife, of mother
to child, of cheat to dupe, of capital to labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in social death, so to speak, a man may be so
placed that he is unable to adapt himself to his surroundings.
His reputation dies and disintegrates like a body
that is incapable of adjusting itself to some blighting
change of climate. Or, in the terminology of physics, responsible
repute may be likened to an obelisk whose
instability increases with its height. A flat stone may
remain in respectable and undisturbed equilibrium for
centuries. The poised pinnacle is pressed upon by every
wind that blows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fall of some such pinnacle is a dramatic incident
in the experience of the community. The noise thereof
is in a hundred ears, and the splintered fragments may be
gaped at by the crowd. Thus it had been with James
Murchison in Roxton town. Neither doctors nor engine-drivers
are permitted to indulge in drink, and in Murchison’s
case the downfall had been the more dramatic
by his absolute refusal to qualify the disgrace. An inquest,
an unflattering finding by the coroner’s jury, a
case for damages threatening to be successfully instituted
by an outraged widow. Amid such social humiliations
the brass plate had disappeared abruptly from the door
of the house in Lombard Street. It was as though Murchison’s
pride had accepted the tragic climax with all
the finality of grim despair. He had even made no attempt
to sell the practice, but, like Cain, he had gone forth
with his wife and with his children, too sensitive in his
humiliation to brave the ordeal of reconquering a lost
respect.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Many months had passed since the furniture dealers’
vans had stood in the roadway outside the house in Lombard
Street, with bass and straw littering the pavement,
and men in green baize aprons going up and down the
dirty steps. Frost was in the air, and the winter sun
burned vividly upon the western hills. A fog of smoke
hung over the straggling town, lying a dark blurr amid
the white-misted meadows. Lights were beginning to
wink out like sparks on tinder. The dull roar of a passing
train came with hoarse strangeness out of the vague
windings of the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the dusk fell, a smart pair of “bays” switched round
the northwest corner of St. Antonia’s Square and clattered
over the cobbles under the spectral hands of the
towering elms. The church clock chimed for the hour
as Parker Steel, furred like any Russian, stepped out of
the brougham, and, slamming the door sharply after him,
ordered the coachman to keep the horses on the move.
Dr. Steel’s brougham was not the only carriage under
St. Antonia’s sleeping elms. A steady beat of hoofs and
a jingling of harness gave a ring of distinction to the quiet
square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel glanced at the warm windows of his house
as he crossed the pavement, and fumbled for his latch-key
in his waistcoat pocket. The sound of music came
from within, ceasing as the physician entered the hall,
and giving place to the brisk murmur of many voices.
A smart parlor-maid emerged from the drawing-room,
carrying a number of teacups, blue and gold, on a
silver tray. The babble of small talk unmuffled by the
open door suggested that Mrs. Betty excelled as a
hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes elapsed before Parker Steel, spruce and
complacent, was bowing himself into his own drawing-room
with the easy unction of a man sure of the distinction
of his own manners. Quite twenty ladies were ready
to receive the physician’s effeminate white fingers. Mrs.
Betty had gathered the carriage folk of Roxton round her.
The heat of the room seemed to have stimulated the
scent of the exotic flowers. The shaded standard lamp,
burning in the bay-window beside the piano, shed a brilliant
light upon a pink mass of azaleas in bloom. Mrs.
Betty herself was still seated upon the music-stool, one
hand resting on the key-board as she chatted to Lady
Sophia Gillingham, sunk deep in the luxurious cushions
of a lounge-chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty, a study in saffron, her pale face warmed
by the light of the lamp, caught her husband’s eye as
he moved through the crowded room. Sleek, brilliant,
pleased as a cat that has been lapping cream, she made a
slight gesture that he understood, a gesture that brought
him before Lady Gillingham’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you touch the bell for me?—I want to show Mignon
to Lady Sophia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s smile congratulated his wife on her deft
handling of the weapons of social diplomacy. He rang
the bell, and meeting the servant at the door, desired her
to bring Mrs. Betty’s blue Persian and the basket of
kittens from before the library fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician took personal charge of Mignon and her
children, and returning between the chairs and skirts,
presented the family to Lady Sophia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel had an ecstatic lady at either elbow as
he held the basket lined with red silk, the three mouse-colored
kittens crawling about within. Mignon, the amber-eyed,
had made a leap for Mrs. Betty’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dears!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How absolutely sweet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such tweety pets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two elderly canaries cheeped in chorus while Lady
Sophia’s fat and pudgy hand fondled the three kittens.
Her red and apathetic face became more human and expressive
for the moment, though there was a suggestion
of cupidity in her dull blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dear things!” and she lifted one from the basket
into her lap, where it mewed rather peevishly, and caught
its claws in Lady Sophia’s lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mignon is a prize beauty,” and Mrs. Betty caressed
the cat, and looked up significantly into her husband’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly lovely. There, there, pet, what a fuss to
make!” and the dowager’s red-knuckled hand contrasted
with the kitten’s slate-gray coat. “I suppose they are all
promised, Mrs. Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to tell the truth, they have created quite a rage
among my friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt, the dears. You could ask quite a fancy
price for such prize kittens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel had been prompted by an instant flash of
his wife’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure if Lady Gillingham would like one of the
kittens—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He appeared to glance questioningly, and for approval,
at Mrs. Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—I shall be delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—may I buy one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel elevated his eyebrows, and, with the air of
a Leicester, refused to listen to any such proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not mention such a matter. We shall only be too
glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear Mrs. Steel—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree wholly with my husband.” And Mrs. Betty
stretched out a white hand, and stroked the ball of fluff
in Lady Sophia’s lap. “Choose which you like. They
can leave the mother in a week or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Gillingham’s plebeian face beamed upon Mrs.
Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is really too generous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, not at all,” and her vivacity was compelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I may choose this one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a pet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mignon, purring on Mrs. Betty’s lap, failed to realize
in the least how valuable a social asset she had proved.
There was a rustling of skirts, a shaking of hands, as the
room began to empty of its silks and laces. Lady Sophia
struggled up with a fat sigh from the depths of her chair,
stroked Mignon’s ears, and held out a very gracious hand
to Mrs. Steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you dine with us on Monday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Gerald Gerson and the Italian ambassador will
be with us. I want to show you some choice Dresden
that my husband has just bought at Christie’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty received the favor with the smiling and enthusiastic
simplicity of an ingenuous girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How kind of you! I am so fond of china.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel gave his arm to the great lady, and escorted
her to her carriage, his deportment a professional triumph
in the consummation of such a courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Mrs. Betty alone in the drawing-room when
he returned. She was lying back in the chair that Lady
Gillingham’s stout majesty had impressed, and had
Mignon and a kitten on her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel, standing on the hearth-rug, looked round
him with the air of a man to whom the flowers in the
vases, the lilies and azaleas in bloom, seemed to exhale an
incense of success. Social prosperity and an abundance
of cash; the expensive arm-chairs appeared to assert the
facts loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A satisfactory party, dear, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty, fondling Mignon’s ears, looked up and
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we have conquered Boadicea at last,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She should be a most excellent advertisement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel fingered his chin, and looked meditatively
at the carpet. A self-satisfied and half-cynical smile hovered
about the angles of his clean-cut mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A year ago, Betty,” he remarked, “Lady Sophia pertained
to Catherine Murchison, and showed us the cold
shoulder. Well, we have changed all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, say the workings of the ‘spirit,’ or the infirmities
of the flesh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty held Mignon against her cheek and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a dear, soft, fluffy thing it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set a cat to catch a cat, eh? I wonder what our
friend Murchison is doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison! I never trouble to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel studied his boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor devil, he made a pretty mess of a first-class
practice. They were hard up, too, I imagine. Damages
and costs must have cleared out most of Murchison’s investments,
and their furniture sold dirt cheap. I can’t
tell why the ass did not try to sell the practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pride, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It meant making me a present of most of his best
patients.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Parker, never complain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly, when we should be booking between two and
three thousand a year—at least. Well, I must turn out
again before dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician returned to his fur coat and his brougham,
leaving Mrs. Betty fondling Mignon and her kittens.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred rows of mud-colored brick “boxes,”
set face to face and back to back. Scores of cobbled
streets, a gray band of stone, and two gray bands of
slate. Interminable brown doors and dingy windows;
interminable black and sour back yards, festoons of
sodden underclothing, moping chickens caged up in
corners, rubbish, broken boxes, cinder heaps, and
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardness in every outline, in the dirty, yellow-walled
houses, in the faces of the women, and in the crude straightness
of every street. An atmosphere of granite, brick,
cast-iron, and slate. No softness of contour, no flow of
curves, no joy in the sweep of land or sky. The color
scheme a smirch of gray, yellow, and dingy red. Scarcely
a streak of green in the monotonous streets. The sky
itself, at best a dusty blue, sliced up into lengths by slate
roofs and cast-iron gutters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the south of this wilderness of brick and stone rose
the chimneys and cage wheels of the Wilton collieries.
Here the sketch had been worked in charcoal, black
wharves beside a black canal, hillocks of coal, black smoke,
black faces. The whirr of wheels, the grinding of shovels,
the banging of trucks being shunted to and fro along the
sidings. The eternal spinning of the cage wheels, the
panting and screaming of engines, the toil and travail of
a civilization that disembowels the very earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Wilton High Street, where electric trams sounded
their gongs all day, and cheap shops ogled the cheap
crowd, there was a broad window that had been colored
red and topped by a line of gold some eight feet above the
pavement. On this sanguinary window ran an inscription
in big, black letters:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line' style='margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tugler</span>, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.</p>
<p class='line' style='margin-top:0.5em;'>Consulting hours, 8 to 10 and 6 to 9</p>
<p class='line' style='margin-top:0.5em;'>Consultations one shilling. Medicines included.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Those be-shawled ladies who carried their rickety infants
into Dr. Tugler’s shop, might find the doctor and one
of his two professional assistants seated in the two cheap,
cane-bottomed arm-chairs before two baize-topped tables.
There were wooden benches round the room, a glass-fronted
cabinet in one corner, medical almanacs on the
walls, a placard over the mantel-piece instructing patients
“To bring their own bottles.” An inner door with ground
glass panels led to a dingy surgery, a white sink in one
corner, and a dresser littered with instrument cases, packages
of lint, reels of plaster, and boxes of bandages. A
third door opened from the surgery into the dispensary,
a veritable bower of bottles, lit by a skylight, a ledger
desk under the gas-jet in one corner, medicine glasses
standing on the sloppy drug-stained dresser, a spirituous
reek filling the little room. Oil-cloth, worn patternless,
covered all the floors. The gas-jet in the surgery flared
perpetually through all the winter months, for the sky-light
was too small and dirty to gather much light from
the December skies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Saturday night at Wilton, and hucksters were
shouting up their wares in High Street, despite the fine
and almost impalpable rain that wrapped everything in
a dismal mist. The gongs of the tram-cars clanged impatiently
past Dr. Tugler’s surgery, where a row of stalls
ranged beside the pavement gathered a crowd of marketers
under their naphtha lamps. Trade had been busy
behind the red window that Saturday evening. Piles of
shillings and sixpences lay in the drawer of Dr. Tugler’s
consulting-table, small change left by anæmic, work-worn
women, who needed food and rest more than Dr. Tugler’s
cheap and not very effectual mixtures. The room had
been full of the bronchitic coughing of old men, the whining
of children, the scent of wet, warm, dirty clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The front room had emptied itself at last, an old woman
with a cancerous lip being the last to go. Dr. Tugler
was sitting at the table nearest to the red window, counting
up the miscellaneous and greasy pile of small coins,
and packing them pound by pound into a black hand-bag
that lay across his knees. He was a vulgar little man
with a cheerful, blustering manner, and a kind of plump
and smiling self-assurance that was never at a loss for
the most dogmatic of opinions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the Wilton colliery folk he was known distinctively
as “the doctor.” A man of finer fibre might
have been wasted amid such surroundings. Dr. Tugler,
florid, bumptious, ever ready with a semi-decent joke,
and boasting an aggressive yet generous aplomb, contrived
to impress his uncultured clients with a sense of
sufficiency and of rough-and-ready power. But for his
frock-coat, and for the binoral stethoscope that dangled
from the top button of his fancy waistcoat, he might have
been taken for a prosperous publican, a bookmaker, or a
butcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler swept the remaining small change into his
bag, locked it, and jumped up with the air of a man eminently
satisfied with the day’s trade. The assistant at the
other table was pencilling a few notes into a pocket-book,
and humming the tune of a popular, music-hall song.
The surgery door opened as Dr. Tugler deposited the
black bag on the mantel-shelf, and a swarthy collier, with
one hand bandaged, came slouching out, swinging an
old cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler faced round with his hands stuffed into his
trousers pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, Smith, find the knife sharp, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man grinned, and glanced at his bandaged hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a tidy lot of muck in it,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good thing we’ve saved the finger. Paid your bob,
eh? Right. Keep off the booze, and go straight home
to the missus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tugler turned down the gas-jets, and entered the surgery.
A big man in a white cotton coat was bending
over the sink and washing a porcelain tray under the hot-water
tap. Blood-stained swabs of wool lay in an old
paper basket under the sink. A couple of scalpels, a
pair of dressing forceps and scissors, a roll of lint, dental
forceps still clutching a decayed tooth, an excised cyst
floating in a bowl of blood-stained water, such were the
details that completed the picture of a general surgeon at
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler cast a quick and observant glance round the
room, turned down the gas a little, and counted the bandages
in a card-board box on the dresser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feel fagged, Murchison, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man turned, his lined and powerful face wearing
a look of patient self-restraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be easy on the bandages,” and Dr. Tugler gave a
frowning wink; “we can’t do the beggars à la West End
on a bob a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man nodded, and began to clean his knives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A message has just come round from Cinder Lane,
No. 10. Primip. Glad if you’d see to it. I feel dead
fagged myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An almost imperceptible sigh and a slight deepening
of the lines about Murchison’s mouth escaped Dr. Tugler’s
notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will start as soon as I have cleaned these instruments.
No. 10, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Here’s the week’s cash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler rapped down three sovereigns and three
shillings on the dresser, and turning into the dispensary,
busied himself by inspecting the contents of the bottles
with the critical eye of a man who realizes that details
decide the difference between profit and loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ten minutes Murchison had taken off his white cotton
coat, pocketed his money, put on a blue serge jacket and
overcoat, and taken a rather shabby bowler from the peg
on the surgery door. He picked up an obstetric bag from
under the dresser, and crossing the outer room with a
curt “good-night” to his fellow-assistant, plunged into
the glare and drizzle of Wilton High Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the rain, the sidewalks were crowded with
Saturday-night bargainers who loitered round the stalls
under the flaring naphtha lamps. The strident voices of
the salesmen mingled with the clangor of the passing teams
and the plaintive whining of the overhead wires. Here
and there the glare from a public-house streamed across
the pavement, and through the swing-doors, Murchison,
as he passed, had a glimpse of the gaudy fittings, the
glittering glasses, the rows of bottles set out like lures to
catch the eye. The bars were crowded with men and
women, the discordant hubbub of their voices striking
out like the waters of a mill-race into the more even murmur
of the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the bag shuddered as he passed these
glittering dens, and felt the hot breath of the “drink
beast” on his face. His eyes seemed to fling back the
glare of the lights with a fierceness that was not far from
fanatical disgust. Possibly there was an element of
mockery for him in the coarse chattering and the braying
laughter. His fingers contracted about the handle of his
bag. He seemed to hurry with the air of some grim wayfarer
in the <span class='it'>Pilgrim’s Progress</span>, escaping from sights and
sounds poignant with the prophecies of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Cinder Lane, Murchison found the door of No. 10
half open, and a man sitting reading in his shirt-sleeves
in the little front parlor. A significant whimpering came
from the room above, the first faint crying of a new-born
child. A flash of relief passed across Murchison’s face.
The sound reprieved him from a possible night-watch
in the stuffy heat of a room that smelled of paraffin,
stale beer, and unwashed clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All over, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the paper rose, removed his clay pipe,
jerked back his chair, and grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jus’ so, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better for every one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord love you, doctor, I feel as though I’d bin sittin’
on ’ot coals for ten mortal hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison swung his overcoat over a chair, and climbed
the stairs, a half open door showing a band of light blotted
by the shadow of a woman’s head. The proud father returned
to his pipe and to his paper and the mug of beer
on the table at his elbow. He looked a mere lad, sickly,
beardless, hatchet-faced, with high shoulders and no
chest. Coal-dust seemed to have been grimed into the
pores of his greasy and wax-white skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lad’s smirk was a quaint mixture of pride and
sheepishness when Murchison came down the stairs half
an hour later and congratulated him on the possession of
a son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad it’s over, doctor. ’Ave a drop?” and he reached
for a clean glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s face hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks very much. Your wife has come through
it very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man put his paper down and held Murchison’s
overcoat for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s a mercy, doctor, that it ain’t twins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a double responsibility, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lad winked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s a cove bin writin’ in this paper as ’ow
every man ought t’ have a woppin’ fam’ly. I sh’ld like to
ask ’im, ‘’ow about the bread and cheese?’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the beer, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ther, doctor, only two bob a week—reg’lar. That
ain’t ruination. It’s a bit sweaty down in the coal-’ole.
I give the missus most of the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” and Murchison smiled at the lad with something
fatherly in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do that, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there ain’t much mistake in makin’ the missus
yer banker when she’s clean and tidy, and looks to a man’s
buttons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned out again into the drizzling rain,
and swung along a dozen dreary streets that resembled
each other much as one curbstone resembles another.
A church clock was striking eleven as he reached a row
of little, red brick villas on the outskirts of the town, with
a dirty piece of waste-land in front and the black canal
behind. He stopped before a gate that bore, as though
in irony, the name “Clovelly.” There was no blue,
boundless Atlantic within glimpse of Wilton town, no
flashing up of golden coast-lines in the sunlight, no towering
cliffs piling green foam towards a sapphire sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The front door opened at the click of the garden gate,
if ten square feet of garden and a gravel-path could be
flattered with the name of a garden. A woman’s figure
stood outlined by the lamp burning in the hall. She was
dressed in a cheap cotton blouse, and skirt of dark-blue
serge, but the clothes looked well on her, better than silks
on the body of another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband’s face drew out of the darkness into the
light. Catherine’s eyes had rested half-questioningly on
it for a moment, the eyes of a woman whose love is ever
on the watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am late, dear,” and he went in with a feeling of
tired relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, your supper is ready. Dear me, what a long
day you have had!” and she glanced at the bag, understanding
at once what had kept him to such an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are the youngsters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asleep since nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine took his coat and hat, and put her arm
through his as they went into the little front room together.
A coke fire glowed in the diminutive grate, a
saucepan full of soup stood steaming on the trivet. Murchison
sat down at the table that was half covered by a
white cloth. At the other end lay his wife’s work-basket,
with a dozen pairs of socks and stockings. Her eyes had
been tired before the opening of the garden gate. Now
they were bright and vital, for love had wiped all weariness
away—that heroic, quiet love that conquers a thousand
sordid trifles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saturday is always busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” and she smiled as she poured him out his
soup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we had nearly a hundred people to-night.
Thanks, dear, thanks,” and he touched her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine sat down on the sofa, and took up her stockings,
seeing that he was tired, too tired to care to talk.
Her woman’s instinct was rarely at a loss, and a tired man
appreciates restfulness in a wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished, she rose and drew the solitary
arm-chair before the fire, and brought him his pipe and
his tobacco. Murchison’s face softened. He never lost
the consciousness of all she had forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew out the week’s money when they had talked
for a while, and handed the three sovereigns to her, keeping
only the three shillings for himself. Catherine wore
the key of their cash-box tied to a piece of ribbon round
her neck. It was Murchison who had insisted on this
precaution. Every week he gave the money to her, and
saw her lock it in the cash-box on her desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I still keep the key, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” and she colored like a girl, “you know that I
trust you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, but I have sworn to myself, dear, to risk
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose slowly and put the money away, glad in her
heart of his quiet and determined strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I mean to crush this curse now—once—and
forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison finished his pipe, and Catherine put her
work away. The front door was locked, the gas turned
out. Husband and wife went up the stairs together,
Catherine carrying the lighted candle. She opened a
door leading from the narrow landing, and they went in,
hand in hand, to look at their two children who were
asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wistful smile hovered about Murchison’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little beggars, they don’t see much of me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was thinking of the past and of the future. Indeed,
he thought the same thoughts nightly as he looked at the
two heads upon the pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwen is looking better again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she?” and he sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had quite a long walk to-day before it began to
rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spoke in undertones, Murchison leaning over
Gwen’s little bed. He looked at her very lovingly, as
though wishing to feel her small arms about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, little one. Good-night, Mischief Jack,”
and he turned to his wife with the air of a man repeating
a solemn and nightly prayer.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Failure is bitter enough in itself to a man of energy
and strength of purpose, but more bitter still are
the humiliations and the sufferings that failure may impose
on those he loves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reputation, resources, his very home, had been swallowed
up, but in Murchison there was that dogged northern
spirit, that stubborn uplift against odds, that is at its
strongest when confronted with defeat. Like a man
brought to the edge of a black cliff at night, he had looked
down grimly into the depths, depths that waited not for
him alone, but for the innocent children who held his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a cheap assistant in a colliery town, James Murchison
had joined issue with his own unfitness for the ordeal
of life. A tight-mouthed and rather silent man, he had
entered upon the rebuilding of his self-respect with the
dogged patience of a Titan. The little, red brick villa,
with the dirty piece of waste land in front and the black
canal behind, might have suggested no stage for heroic
drama to the casual eyes of Murchison’s neighbors. The
big, brown-faced man stalked to and fro to work, quiet
and unobtrusive, a figure that was soon familiar to most
of the middle-class people who lived on either side. He
seemed one of those many mortals who move through
life without a history, an ant in an ant world, busy, monotonously
busy, earning his paltry pounds a week, without
glamour, and without fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man suffers most in seeing those dear to him in suffering,
and the tragic tones of life are caught from the lips
of those he loves. The wounds of a wife or of a child are
open in the heart of the husband or father. Remorse or
self-accusation, if there be cause for such a feeling, is as
the vinegar on the sponge to the man crucified by his own
sin. One has but to come in contact with the material
side of civilization to discover how desperately sordid this
twentieth-century life can be. How great the contrast
was between Roxton lying amid its woods and meadows,
and the dismal colliery town, Murchison, as a father,
realized too soon. The one smelled of the fresh earth,
primal and invigorating; the other of soap-works, soot,
cabbage-water, and rancid oil. In Roxton the mortality
was low; in the colliery town hundreds of infants died
yearly before they were four weeks old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such realism, the vivid heritage of thousands, might
well make a man go grimly through life, the burden of
care very heavy on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To watch a wife’s face fade, despite her courage, poverty
and sorrow bringing weariness to the serenest eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To know that drudgery burdens the dear life of the
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To watch the lapsing of a child from sheer health
into sickness, the beautiful aliveness vanishing, the bloom
marred like the bloom on handled fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consciousness of dependence and obligation, the
receiving of brusque instructions from a man of cheap
and vulgar fibre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sordid surroundings, sordid neighbors, an utter dearth
of friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Work, eternal work, day in, day out; no Sabbath rest,
no time for home life, no money to give joy to those most
dear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vivid ghost past following, like a shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dim and unflattering future before the eyes, a future
darkened by the prophetic dread of leaving wife and
children alone in a selfish world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the realities that filled James Murchison’s
sphere of consciousness, realities that were responsible
for many a sleepless night.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the afternoon of a February day when Murchison
stopped before the theatre in Wilton High Street, for
the colliery town delighted in melodrama, and pulling
out a pigskin purse, examined the contents with critical
consideration. He had saved a few shillings by stinting
himself in tobacco, and in his daily lunch at a cheap
eating-house near Dr. Tugler’s surgery. The pantomime
“Puss in Boots” was still running at the theatre,
and at the box-office Murchison bought four tickets for
the upper circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the old days the children had gone up yearly to
Drury Lane, and Master Jack had been making many
allusions to the gaudy “posters” covering a hoarding
near the row of red brick villas. More than once the
boy’s thoughtless words had hurt the father’s heart. It
was chiefly of Gwen that Murchison thought as he thrust
the envelope with its yellow slips into his breast-pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Clovelly, Catherine, her sleeves turned up, stood in
the little back kitchen making a suet-pudding. The
Murchisons had dispensed with a servant because of the
expense, for their income had practically no margin, and
money had to be scraped together to pay the yearly dividend
on the husband’s life-insurance. Catherine’s mother,
a somewhat stern, pious, and bedridden old lady, living
in a respectable south-coast town, allowed her daughter a
small sum each year. Mrs. Pentherby was the possessor
of a comfortable income, but suffered from a meanness
of mind and a severity of prejudice that had made her
rather merciless to Murchison in the hour of his misfortune.
Such money as she sent was to be spent “solely
on the children.” Catherine’s face had often reddened
over the contents of her mother’s drastic and didactic
letters. Her love and her loyalty were hurt by the old
lady’s blunt and Puritanical advice. As for James Murchison,
he had too much pride to ever dream of touching
Mrs. Pentherby’s “ear-marked” donations to his children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On several occasions a five-pound note had reached
Clovelly anonymously from another quarter. Murchison
had suspected Porteus Carmagee of this noiseless
generosity, but he had been unable to discover whence
the money came. The little lawyer of Lombard Street
alone knew how the phenomenal damages accorded to
Mrs. Baxter by a sentimental jury had swept away all
Murchison’s savings, and even the money realized by
the sale of his furniture and his car. Yet these five-pound
notes were always placed in Catherine’s hands, to be deposited
in the post-office savings-bank in Gwendolen
Murchison’s name. At Christmas a huge hamper had
reached them from Roxton, a hamper whose bulk had
symbolized the abundant kindness of Miss Carmagee’s
virgin heart. Friends in adversity are friends worthy of
honor, and Miss Carmagee, good woman, had packed the
hamper with her own fat and generous hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine, her fore-arms white with flour, stood in the
little back kitchen, tying a piece of cloth over the pudding-bowl
before sinking it in the steaming saucepan on the
fire. The winter day was drawing towards twilight.
Mists hung over the black canal. Through the windows
could be seen the zinc roofs of a number of storage sheds
attached to the buildings of a steam-mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the front parlor the horse-hair sofa had been drawn
beneath the window, and Gwen, her golden head on a
faded blue cushion, lay, trying a new frock on a great
wax doll. The child’s eyes looked big and strange in her
pale face, and the blue veins showed through the pearly
skin. Apathy in a child is pathetic in its unnaturalness,
the more so when the sparkle of health has but lately left
the eager eyes. Gwen had whitened like a plant deprived
of life. Her black-socked legs were no longer brown and
chubby. She had the unanimated and drooping look of
a child languid under the spell of some insidious disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The garden gate closed with a clash as Master Jack
came crunching up the gravel-path, swinging his ragged
school-books at the end of a strap. He grimaced at
Gwen, and rang the bell with the cheerful verve of youth,
for John Murchison was a sturdy ragamuffin, capable of
adapting himself to changed surroundings. The young
male is a creature of mental resilience and resource.
Toys were fewer, puddings plainer, parties unknown.
But a boy can find treasures in a rubbish heap and mystery
in the dirty waters of a canal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Jack’s return from school was usually a noisy
incident. He appeared loud and emphatic, an infallible
autocrat of eight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang went the books into a corner of the hall. For
the hundredth time Catherine reproved her son, and insisted
on Master Jack’s “primers” being put in order on
the proper shelf. The boy, much under compulsion,
stooped for those battered symbols of civilization, disclosing
in the act a disastrous rent in his blue serge
knickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, dear, what have you been doing to your clothes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What clothes, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s innocent yet subtle obtuseness did not save
him from further catechisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only mended your knickers yesterday, Jack, and
they were new last month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My knickers, mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Jack passed a hypocritical hand over a certain
region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say ‘lor,’ dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never! I was only climbin’ with Bert Smith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t think, Jack, that clothes cost money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was perfectly plain that no such thought ever entered
Jack Murchison’s head. Children are serenely insensible
to the worries of their elders, and, moreover,
Master Jack had at the moment a grievance of his
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bert Smith’s going to the pantomime,” and he pushed
past his mother into the front room; swinging his books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, be careful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t we go to the pantomime? It’s a beastly
shame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s lips quivered almost imperceptibly. The
blatant self-assertiveness of boyhood hurt her, as the
thoughtless grumblings of a child must often hurt a
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put those books down, dear, and go and change your
knickers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack obeyed, if swinging the books into a corner could
be called obedience. Catherine restrained a gesture of
impatience. Gwen, lying on the sofa, winced at the clatter
as though morbidly sensitive to sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are silly, Jack!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muvver’s tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reproof from a supposed inferior is never particularly
welcome. Jack made a clutch at his sister’s doll, landed
it by one leg, and proceeded to dangle it head downward
before the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack—Jack—don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy chuckled like a tyrant as Gwen, peevish and
hypersensitive, burst into a flood of tears. Catherine,
who had turned back into the kitchen, reappeared in time
to rescue the doll from being melted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, I am ashamed of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the doll from him, and went to the window to
comfort Gwen. John Murchison, conscious of humiliation,
adopted an attitude of aggressive scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly old doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, go up to the nursery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sha’n’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His courage melted rather abruptly, however, before the
look upon his mother’s face. He retreated at his leisure,
climbed the stairs slowly, whistling as he went, and kicking
the banisters with the toes of his boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A grieved voice reached Catherine from the half-dark
landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t we go to the pantomime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go into the nursery, dear, and don’t grumble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bert Smith’s going. I call it a beastly shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, if you say another word I shall send you to
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes had hardly elapsed before Catherine heard
her husband’s footsteps on the path, and the rattle of his
latch-key in the lock. In the front room he found poor
Gwen still sobbing spasmodically in her mother’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight damped the glow on Murchison’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, what’s the matter?” and the anxious lines came
back in his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, dear, nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, little one, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine surrendered her place to him. Murchison’s
arms went round the child. Gwen, though struggling to
be brave, broke out again into uncontrollable and helpless
weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’s tired, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired! there, there! You must not cry like this,” and
the big man’s face was a study in troubled tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has upset her, Kate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack has been teasing her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young scoundrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy’s in one of his trying moods.” And she
could find no more to say against her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gwen grew comforted in her father’s arms. Yet to
this man who had learned to watch the faces of the sick,
there was something ominous in the child’s half-fretful
eyes, in the way she flushed, and in the hurrying of her
heart. He felt her hands; they were hot and feverish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Husband and wife looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired, little one, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, very tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay with her head on her father’s shoulder, looking
with large, languid eyes up into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By-bye time for little girls who are going to see ‘Puss
in Boots’ to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gwen’s eyes brightened a little; her hands held the
lappets of her father’s coat-collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—daddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison felt in his pocket and drew out the envelope
with the yellow tickets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you would like to see ‘Puss in Boots’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, oh yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little girls who go to pantomimes must go to bed
early. Shall daddy carry you up-stairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tired but ecstatic sigh accepted the condition. Murchison
lifted the child, kissed her, and smiled sadly at his
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about your unregenerate son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine turned, and called to Jack, who was listening
at the nursery door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, dear, you may come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A clatter of feet pounded down the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet, dear, quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, Bert Smith’s going to the pantomime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, is he? Well, so are we.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To ‘Puss in Boots’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if a certain young gentleman is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack gave a shout of triumph, kissed Gwen, and skipped
round the room as Murchison went out with his daughter
in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy ran to Catherine, and jumped up to her embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, mother,” and his bright face vanquished
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tore my knickers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Catherine took the confession in the spirit that it
was given.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Though the most agile of mock cats cut capers behind
the foot-lights, and though forty fairies in green
and crimson fluttered their gauzy wings under the paste-board
trees, Gwen Murchison sat silent and solemn-eyed
beside her father, while her brother shouted over the
vagaries of Selina the Cook. The glitter, the kaleidoscopic
color, the gaudy incidentalism of the mummery
could charm only a transient light into Gwen’s eyes. She
sat beside Murchison, with one hot hand in his, her face
shining like a white flower out of the depths of the crowded
balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, I’m so tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the theatre arcade with a great electric
light blazing above their heads. People were pouring
from the vestibule. A line of trams and cabs waited in
the roadway to drain the human flood streaming out into
the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired, little one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So tired, daddy! My head, it does ache.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the glare of the electric arc Murchison’s face
had a haggard look as he took Gwen up like a baby in
his arms. Jack was hanging to his mother’s hand, garrulous
and ecstatic, a slab of warm chocolate browning
his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go in the tram, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine was following her husband’s powerful figure,
as he pushed through the crowd with Gwen lying in his
arms. Murchison had hailed a cab, a luxury that he had
not allowed himself for many a long week. The wife
caught a glimpse of her husband’s face as he turned to
her. There was something in his eyes that made her
look at Gwen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, daddy, how that old—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet, dear, quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s shrill voice died down abruptly. He looked
puzzled, and a little offended, and began cramming chocolate
into his mouth. Murchison had opened the cab
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s eyes interrogated her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in, dear; can you take her from me? The child
is dead tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gwen appeared half asleep. Her eyes opened vaguely
as her father lifted her into the cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My head aches, muvver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it, dear?” and Catherine’s arms drew close
about her; “we shall soon be home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In with you, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy scrambled into a corner, fidgeted to and fro,
and stared at his mother. Murchison followed him, closing
the door gently, and putting up both windows, for the
night was raw and cold. The cab rumbled away over
the Wilton cobbles, the windows clattering like castanets,
the light from the street-lamps flashing in rhythmically
upon the faces of Catherine and her children. Murchison
had sunk into his corner with a heavy sigh. The
cab had a sense of smothering confinement for him. With
the crunching wheels and the chattering windows, he was
too conscious, through the oppressive restlessness of it all,
of Gwen’s tired and apathetic face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Jack, don’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child stirred in her mother’s arms with a peevish
cry. Her brother, who had devoured his chocolate, had
squirmed forward to tickle his sister’s legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s voice was fierce in its suppressed impatience.
Jack crumbled into his corner, while his
mother soothed Gwen and stroked her hair. A distant
church clock chimed the quarter as the cab turned a
corner slowly, and stopped before the blank-faced villa.
Murchison climbed out and took Gwen from his wife’s
arms. He unlocked the door, and laid the child on the
sofa by the window, before returning to pay the man his
fare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two bob, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison felt in his pockets, and brought out a shilling,
a sixpence, and two half-pennies. The little cash-box
in Catherine’s desk had to be unlocked before the cab
rattled away, leaving a solitary candle burning in the front
room of Clovelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In half an hour the two children were in bed; Gwen
feverish, restless, Jack reduced to silence by his father’s
quiet but unquestionable authority. Murchison examined
Gwen anxiously as she lay with her curls gathered
up by a blue ribbon. He made her up a light draught of
bromide, sweetened it with sugar, and persuaded the
child to drink it down. Master Jack Murchison was
ordered to lie as quiet as a mouse. Then Catherine and
her husband went down to a plain and rather dismal supper,
cold boiled mutton, rice-pudding, bread and cheese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the meal was over, Catherine glided up-stairs to
look at Gwen. She found both children asleep. Jack
curled up like a puppy, the girl flushed, but breathing
peacefully. In the dining-room Murchison had drawn
an arm-chair before the fire, and was stirring the dull coal
into a blaze. He glanced uneasily over his shoulder as he
heard his wife’s step upon the threshold. Catherine was
struck by his lined and thoughtful face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband continued to stir the fire, his eyes catching
a restless gleam from the wayward flicker of the
flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am bothered about the child, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned a chair from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This last month—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have noticed the change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rested his elbows on his knees, and sat close over
the fire, moving the poker to and fro as though beating
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has lost flesh and color. There is a swollen gland
in the neck, too. This beast of a town, I suppose, with
its dirt and smoke. Thank God, the boy seems fit enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke slowly, yet with an emphatic curtness that
might have suggested lack of feeling to a sentimentalist.
Catherine sat in silence, watching him with troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suspect anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suspect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned sharply, and she could see the nervous
twitching of his brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything serious? Oh—James, don’t keep me in
ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped from her chair, and sat down beside him on
the hearth-rug, leaning against his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child is out of health, dear. It may mean anything
or nothing. I am wondering”—and he stopped
with a tired sigh—“whether we can give her a change of
air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met his eyes, and colored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can find the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine pretended not to notice the humiliating bitterness
in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can be managed. I think mother would take Gwen.
I’m sure she would take her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison smiled the unpleasant, cynical smile of a
man unwilling to ask a favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grandparents are always more merciful to their
grandchildren,” he said; “I suppose because there is less
responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine reached for his hand, and drew it down into
her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will write at once, James, if you are willing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no right to object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Object!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beggars are not choosers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I realize my position, dear, and I accept it as a law
of nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face, wistful with a wealth of unshed tears, appealed
to him for mercy towards himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let us talk of it. Oh, James, why should we?
Then, I may write to mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knelt up and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved, if Gwen should die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life was a somewhat monotonous affair at Dr. Tugler’s
dispensary. Method was essential to the management
of such a business, for there was more of the commercial
enterprise in Dr. Tugler’s profession than a wilful idealist
could have wished. Surgery hours began at eight, and
Dr. Tugler’s was a punctual personality. Day in, day
out, he bustled into the red-windowed front room as the
hand of the clock came to the hour. Nothing but the
most flagrant necessity was permitted to interfere with the
precision of his practice. And since John Tugler did not
spare his own body, it was not reasonable that he should
spare those who worked for hire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was March 2d, a Tuesday, with a wet fog clogging
the streets, when James Murchison arrived at the dispensary
as the clock struck nine. The front room, packed
as to its benches, steamed like a stable. The indescribable
odor that emanates from the clothes of the poor
made the air heavy with the smell of the unwashed slums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler glanced up briskly as the big man entered,
screwed up his mouth, nodded, and jerked an elbow in
the direction of the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bustle along, Mr. Murchison. There are half a
dozen cases waiting for you in the surgery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison said nothing, but passed on. His face had
a white, drawn look, and he seemed to move half-blindly,
like a man exhausted by a long march in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tugler looked at him curiously, frowned, and then
rattled off a string of directions to an old woman seated
beside him, her red hands clutching the old leather bag
in her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Medicine three times a day—before meals. Drop
the drink. Regular food. Come again next week.
Shilling? That’s right. Next—please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman’s sodden face still poked itself towards
the doctor with senile eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’ope you won’t be minding me, sir, but this ’ere—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler became suddenly deaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in the atmosphere suggestive of
a barber’s shop. A robust collier was already waiting
for the old lady to vacate her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was goin’ to ask you, doctor—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This time next week. We’re busy. Good-morning,
Smith; sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman licked a drooping lip with a sharp, dry
tongue, looked at the doctor dubiously, and began to
fumble in her bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got a box of pills ’ere, sir, as—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tugler cleared his throat irritably, and appeared surprised
to find her still sitting at his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bowels, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, as I might say, sir, I’m obstinate, very obstinate—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s look at the box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t be thinkin’, doctor, there’s any ’arm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harm! Bread and ginger. Take the lot. Sit down,
Smith,” and Dr. Tugler’s emphasis ended the discussion
with the finality of fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the room had cleared, and the last bottle had
been passed through the dispensary window, that opened
like the window of a railway booking-office into the alley
at the side of the shop, Dr. Tugler marched into the surgery
where Murchison had finished syringing the wax
out of an old man’s ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Overslept yourself, Murchison? I must buy you an
alarum, you know, if it happens again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was washing his hands at the tap over the
sink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “I was up half the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler, cheerful little bully that he was, noticed
the sag of the big man’s shoulders, and the peculiar
harshness of his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get through with it all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison stared momentarily at Dr. Tugler over his
shoulder, a glance that had the significance of the flash
of a drawn sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not one of your cases,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Private affair, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child is ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’m a bit worried, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned the tap off with a jerk, rasped the
dirty towel round the roller, and began to dry his hands
as though he were trying to crush something between his
palms. Dr. Tugler thrust out a lower lip, looked hard
at Murchison, and fidgeted his fists in his trousers-pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man’s silence suggested for a moment that he
resented the abruptness of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say—yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler frowned a little, stared hard at the ventilator,
and pulled his hands out of his pockets with a jerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Murchison, you’ve lost your nerve a little.
I’ll come round and have a look at the youngster.
You had better knock off work to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I’d rather stick to it. You might see the
child, though. I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison had turned his face away, and was standing
by the window, fumbling with his cuff links.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like the look of things. I don’t know why,
but a man’s nerve seems to go when he’s doctoring his
own kin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” and Dr. Tugler nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll come round?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing we go at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bosh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dr. Tugler turned into the front room, took his
top-hat from the gas bracket, and began to polish it with
his sleeve.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A March wind blew the dust and dead leaves in
eddies through the breadth of Castle Gate as Dr.
Steel’s brougham drew up before the timbered front of
a Jacobean house. The mellow building with its carved
barge-boards and great sweeping gables bore the date of
1617, and still carried a weather-worn sign swinging on
an iron bracket. For the last fifty years the ground floor
had been used as a grocery shop, a dim, rambling cavern
of a place fragrant with the scent of coffee and spices.
The proprietor, Mr. Isaac Mainprice, a very superior
tradesman who dabbled in archæology, had refrained
from gilt lettering above the door; nor did the quaint
leaded windows glare with advertisements, whiskey bottles,
and Dutch cheeses. Every one within ten miles of
Roxton knew Mr. Mainprice. His prosperity did not
need to be flaunted upon his windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, madam. Terribly windy. Permit me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty had swept across the pavement in her sables,
an opulent figure wooed by the March wind. Mr. Mainprice
had fussed forward in person. He bowed in his
white apron, swung a chair forward, and then dodged behind
the counter. The shop was empty, and three melancholy
assistants studied Mrs. Betty from behind pyramids
of sweetmeats and packages of tea, for the face under the
white toque had all the imperative fascination of smooth
and confident beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Steel drew out a little ivory memorandum-book,
and glanced at it perfunctorily, before looking up into Mr.
Mainprice’s attentive face. He was a weak-eyed, damp-haired
man, with a big nose and a loose, good-tempered
mouth. A patch of red on either cheek seemed to suggest
that the <span class='it'>épicier</span> cultivated an authoritative taste in
port, sherry, and Madeira.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want some jellies and soups, Mr. Mainprice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are a few poor people my husband attends. I
want to help them with a few little delicacies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s drawl was most confidentially sympathetic,
and Mr. Mainprice ducked approvingly behind the
counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brand, madam? Lazenby’s, Cross &amp; Blackwell’s—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—the best—what you recommend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” and Mrs. Betty’s eyes wandered with
an air of delightful innocence about the shop; “I like the
glassed jellies best. Six. Yes, six. And six tins of desiccated
soup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, madam. The large size?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Will you have them made up into different
parcels? I will take them in the carriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mainprice nodded sharply to the three melancholy
assistants, and then bent over the counter to scribble in
his order-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very windy weather, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty glanced up brightly at the suave, thin-whiskered
face, and smiled. She had a great variety of
smiles, and Mr. Mainprice was an intelligent person, and
a man who was not ashamed of wearing a white apron.
Moreover, he was an excellent patient, the father of five
tall and unhealthy daughters, and the sympathetic husband
of a neurasthenic wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Terribly windy,” she agreed. “This is a dear old
house, but I suppose it is rather draughty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, madam, no, we find it very comfortable. I have
had double windows fitted to the upper rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They make such a difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a difference, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short pause. Mr. Mainprice was a nervous
man. He had a habit of sniffing, and of opening and
shutting his order-book as though it was imperative for
him to keep his hands occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Steel is very busy, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very busy; so much influenza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid, madam,” and Mr. Mainprice elongated
himself over the counter with a waggish side twist of the
head—“I am afraid we selfish people don’t show Dr.
Steel much mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you yourself have been particularly wicked
this winter, Mr. Mainprice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must plead guilty, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quite well now, I hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mainprice frowned, and half shut one eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly well, madam. I ventured out last night without
orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Primrose League Concert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, madam, you have found me out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty and the <span class='it'>épicier</span> regarded each other with a
sympathetic sense of humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were there, Mr. Mainprice, and I was so annoyed
because Dr. Steel was called away just before your daughter
sang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, madam,” and Mr. Mainprice sniffed with
nervous satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best item on the programme. Such a sweet contralto,
and such musical feeling. I remember poor Mrs.
Murchison used to sing some of the same songs. Of
course she never had your daughter’s artistic instinct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mainprice colored, and looked coy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl has had first-class lessons, Mrs. Steel. I
believe in having the best of everything. I have been
very fortunate, madam, and though I ought not to mention
it, money is no consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grocer straightened his back suddenly, with a mild
snigger of self-salutation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money well spent, Mr. Mainprice—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is money invested, madam. Exactly. And a good
education is an investment in these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of the melancholy assistants were carrying the
parcels to Mrs. Betty’s carriage. She rose with a rustle
of silks, her rich fur jacket setting off her slim but sensuous
figure. Mr. Mainprice dodged from behind the
counter, and preceded her to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it will be any convenience, Mrs. Steel, we can deliver
the parcels immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I want to see the people myself. I like
to keep in touch with the poor, Mr. Mainprice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grocer’s weak eyes honored a ministering angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly, madam. Permit me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He edged through the door with a nervous clearing of
the throat, blinked as the wind blew a cloud of dust
across the road, and escorted my Lady Bountiful to her
carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What address, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so much, Mr. Mainprice, the coachman
knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mr. Mainprice stood on the curb for fully ten
seconds, watching Dr. Steel’s brougham bear this most
charming lady upon her round of Christian kindness and
pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is wise in this world to cultivate a reputation for
philanthropy, though like the priestly dress it may be a
mere sanctity of the surface. Few people are honest
enough to be open egotists, and to attain our ends it is
necessary to skilfully bribe our neighbors’ prejudices.
Though self-interest is the motive power that keeps the
world from flagging, it is neither discreet nor cultured to
blatantly acknowledge such a truth, for without a certain
measure of hypocrisy life would be a sorry scramble. That
man should be taught to love his neighbor as himself is
both admirable and inspiring, and yet no one who respects
his banking account could ever seriously accept
so unbusiness-like a theory. There was more shrewd,
honest, and unflinching truth-telling in Hobbes than in
the vaporings of a flimsy sentimentalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Mrs. Betty had no more love for a washerwoman
sick with a carbuncle on her neck than she had for an old
and mildewed boot. Poverty and the inevitable sordidness
thereof were more than distasteful to her, and yet
she was so far sound in her worldly philosophy as to dissemble
her distaste for expediency’s sake. It is never
foolish to be suspected of generosity. And in Roxton,
where the ladies counted one another’s yearly record as
to hats, it was necessary to assume some sort of benignant
attitude towards the heathen or the poor. Betty Steel, as
the leading physician’s wife, recognized the power of
judicious and moral self-advertisement. She had lived
down her mischievous desire to shock the good people
who paid her husband’s pleasant bills. No doubt she
derived some delicate satisfaction from playing the fair
lady in her furs, and from conferring favors on her humbler
neighbors. The sense of superiority is always pleasant.
That man is a liar who describes himself as utterly
indifferent to obloquy or favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty stopped at a florist’s shop on her way and
bought three bundles of Scilla flowers. The golden
blooms made a kind of splendor beside her sable coat.
Colonel Feveril, Roxton’s most antique dandy, passed as
she returned towards her brougham, and the brisk sweep
of the soldier’s hat saved her the trouble of remembering
her mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of one of the alleys leading to the river, Dr.
Steel’s wife disembarked upon her errand of mercy. A
small boy whipping a top on the narrow sidewalk served
as a porter for the carrying of her jellies. One or two
greasy heads were poked out of the pigeon-holes of windows.
Mrs. Betty, demure and sweet as any Dorcas,
knocked at the door of No. 5.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, Mrs. Ripstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An elderly woman in a faded blue flannel blouse had
thrust a beak of a nose round the edge of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thin, hard face offered no very fulsome welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is your husband? Dr. Steel told me yesterday
that he was a little better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Ripstone’s lethargic eyes rested for a moment on
the small boy carrying the parcels. Mrs. Betty herself
bore the golden flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged, ma’am; my ’usband is doin’ as well as
can be expected. Will you step in? We ain’t particular
tidy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty stepped in, and sat down calmly on a very
rickety chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have brought you a little soup, and two glasses of
jelly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged to you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women looked curiously at each other. They
were utterly unlike in any characteristic. Mrs. Betty in
her furs looked like a Russian countess in the hovel of a
peasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was unconditionally dirty, and smelled of
burned fat. There was nothing to admire in it, nothing
to provide the lady with a subject for enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad your husband is better, Mrs. Ripstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman in the blue blouse stood stolidly by the
table. Mrs. Betty’s words made no evident impression
on her. It was as though she regarded the visit as a
necessary evil, and was only persuaded to be polite by
such tangible blessings as might accrue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Ripstone stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brevity was expressive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be very busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am that, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they all grown up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grow’d up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ma’am,” and the woman in the blue blouse gave
a peculiar smile, “if you’ll listen you’ll ’ear the baby
’ammerin’ a tin pot in the yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reek of the burned fat began to prove too powerful
for Mrs. Betty’s sensitive soul. She and Mrs. Ripstone
seemed out of sympathy. Conversation languished. The
lady, with all her cleverness, was wholly at a loss what to
say next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two minutes had passed when Dr. Steel’s wife rose.
She smiled one of her perfunctory smiles at the woman
in the blue blouse, and turned with a rustling petticoat
towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope your husband will like the soup, Mrs. Ripstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-afternoon, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman watched Mrs. Betty to her carriage, and
then closed the door with an expression of rather sour
relief. She turned to the flowers and parcels on the
table, untied the string, and examined the contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder what she’s left ’em for;” such was Mrs.
Ripstone’s solitary and cynical remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her carriage Mrs. Betty was holding an enamelled
scent-bottle to her nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder why they are so dirty and so reserved,” she
thought; “I don’t think that woman was the least bit
grateful. I don’t like the poor. Anyway, I have done
my duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The west was wreathed with the torn crimson of a
wind-blown sky at sunset when Mrs. Betty drove home
from her essay in almsgiving. St. Antonia’s spire, a
black and slender wedge, seemed to cleave the vastness
of the flaming west. The tall elms about the
church were very restless with the wailing of the
wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Parker Steel’s dining-room there was an air of
warmth and luxury, a sense of deep shelter from the blustering
melancholy of the dying day. The table was laid
for tea, a silver kettle singing above the spirit-lamp, a
plate of hot cakes on the trivet before the piled-up fire.
It was the hour of soft, slanting shadows, and of the wayward
yet sleepy flickering of the flames. Betty swept
into the room with the sensuous satisfaction of a cat. The
thick Turkey carpet muffled her footsteps like the moss
of a forest “ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the window, his figure outlined by the gold and
purple of a fading sky, she saw her husband standing
motionless, his head bent forward over an out-stretched
hand. He appeared to be examining something closely
in the twilight. She could see his keen, clear profile,
intent and a little stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker, Parker, the cakes are burning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband turned with a start, taken unawares, like
the hero of Wessex in the swineherd’s hut. Betty Steel
had glided towards the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Preoccupation—thy name is man! Parker, quick,
your handkerchief. The dish is as hot as—Say something,
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the glow of the fire she noticed the irritable frown
upon her husband’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most worried of men, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fate cannot touch us, the cakes are saved. Misery,
Parker! Quick, the kettle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silver spout was spouting hot water over Mrs.
Betty’s treasured Japanese tray. Her husband with a
“damn the thing,” turned down the cap of the spirit-lamp
with a spoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an infernal fool that girl Symons is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty drew a chair forward with her foot, reached
for the tea-caddy, and glanced whimsically across the
table at her much grieved mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The king did not try to shift the responsibility, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Steel sat down abruptly, with the air of a man in
no mood for persiflage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you studying so intently?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Learning palmistry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel helped himself to one of the hot cakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a retort to give a woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physician shifted his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Betty, am I to go into a lengthy dissertation
on every trifle because you happen to be inquisitive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me the trifle, and you shall have your tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was looking at a chilblain on my finger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What admirable bathos, Parker! I might have taken
you for Hamlet soliloquizing for the last time over Ophelia’s
tokens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quite possibly,” and he began to sip his tea;
“you have forgotten the sugar. What execrable memories
you women have!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, my head, my head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie quiet, little one. Hold her hands, Kate.
Drink it all down, Gwen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t! Daddy, my head, oh, my head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. John Tugler, standing before the nursery window,
bit one corner of his mustache, and stared hard at the
chimney of the steam-mill trailing a plume of smoke across
the dull gray of the sky. The monotonous cooing of a
dove came from a wooden cage hung in the back yard of
the next-door house. A hundred yards away an iron
railway bridge crossed the canal, and the thunder of each
passing train made peace impossible in the little villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler pulled down the blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beast of a back room,” he thought; “they must wring
the neck of that confounded bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, and stood looking in silence at the two
figures bending over the little bed. Catherine had one
arm under the child’s head, and was smoothing back the
hair from Gwen’s forehead. The child’s eyes were closed,
her face flushed. Tugler saw her turn restlessly from her
mother’s arm, as though the least touch was feverishly
resented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, don’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, dear, there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look in the mother’s eyes betrayed how sharply
such an innocent repulse could wound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Gwen, darling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should let her rest, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s voice was peculiarly quiet. He was standing
at the foot of the bed, bending forward a little over
the bar, his eyes fixed on the face of the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler moved softly from the window. His habitual
bluster had disappeared completely. His full blue
eyes looked dull and puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much of a room—this,” he said, apologetically,
touching Murchison’s elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father turned and looked at him with the slow and
almost stupid stare of a man suffering from shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can move her to the front room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had caught John Tugler’s meaning. She
was kneeling beside the bed, her eyes fixed on the little
man’s plebeian but good-natured face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move her, Mrs. Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She must be kept absolutely quiet; no light, no
noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine looked at him almost helplessly. A train
was clanging over the iron bridge, and the caged dove
cooed irrepressibly, a living symbol of vexatious sentimentalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be less noise in the front room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can have straw put down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And tell the next-door people to strangle that confounded
pigeon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will ask them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And remember, no light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shrill cry came from the sick child’s lips, as though
driven from her by some sudden flaring up of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My head, my head! Muvver—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s hands flashed out to Gwen, hovering, as
though fearing to touch the fragile thing she loved. She
tried to soothe the child, a woman whose wounded tenderness
overflowed in a flood of broken and disjointed words.
Her husband watched her, his firm mouth loosened into
a mute and poignant tremor of distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tugler touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison straightened, and followed the doctor to
the door. He looked back for a moment, and saw Catherine’s
head, a dull gleam of gold above the child’s flushed
face. A strange shock of awe ran through him, like the
deep in-drawing of a breath before some picture that tells
of tears. His vision blurred as he closed the door, and
followed John Tugler slowly down the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both men were silent for a moment in the little front
room of Clovelly. Tugler had taken his stand between
the sofa and the table, and was watching Murchison out
of the angles of his eyes. He was accustomed to dealing
with ignorant people, but here he had to satisfy a man
whose professional education had been far better than his
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell me of this before, Murchison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison glanced at him blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was my own affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t like to bother any one, eh? You never ought
to have kept the youngster in this beast of a town. I
could have told you a lot about Wilton if you had asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler, like many amiable but rather coarse-fibred
people, was often most brusque when meaning to
be kind. Moreover, he had a certain measure of authority
to maintain, and for the maintenance of authority
it was customary for him to wax aggressive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to get the child away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison spoke monotonously, yet with effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wrote to her grandmother, but the old lady was
ill, and put us off with excuses. The child was only ailing
then. It was a matter of money. The only money
I could lay my hands on was a small sum deposited with
the post-office in the child’s own name. And when I
got the money—I saw that it would be no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The florid little man looked sincerely vexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have mentioned it,” he said—“you ought
to have mentioned it. I’m not so damned stingy as not
to give a brother practitioner’s child a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison lifted his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” he said. “I suppose it is too late now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes met Dr. Tugler’s. The grim question in that
look demanded the sheer truth. John Tugler understood
it, and met it like a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t move her now,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is incredible what meaning a single word can carry.
With Murchison that “no” meant the surrender of a life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Tugler stared out of the window, and rattled his
keys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you notice the squint?” he asked, softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the retraction of the head? She’s been sick, too:
cerebral vomiting. Damn the disease, I’ve seen too
much of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s face might have been sculptured by
Michael Angelo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you think it is that?” he asked, dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tubercular meningitis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short and distraught silence before the
little man picked up his hat. He smoothed it gently with
the sleeve of his coat. Murchison stood motionless, staring
at the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced up and met the other man’s dull eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t work to-day. It doesn’t signify. And
about the cash—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, we’re not going to quarrel, are we? The
work’s been pretty thick this winter. I’m rather thinking
you’ve done rather more than your share. It would
make things more comfortable, now—wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison gave a kind of groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good of you, Tugler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bosh, man! Am I a bit of flint? Call it another
pound a week. It isn’t much at that. I’ll send you a
fiver on account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave his hat a last rub, crammed it on his head, and
walked hurriedly towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good of you, Tugler. I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I don’t want it talked about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man was already in the hall, and fumbling
for the handle of the front door. He opened it, slipped
out like a guilty debtor, and crunched down the gravel,
swearing to himself after the manner of the egregious
male.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The windows of Parker Steel’s consulting-room looked
out on the garden at the back of the house, where
Lent lilies were already swinging their golden heads over
borders of crocuses, purple, yellow, and white. The lower
part of the window was screened by a wire gauze blind,
and the red serge curtains were looped back close to the
shutters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However drab and dismal it may be, a physician’s consulting-room
has much of the mystery that shadows the
confessional of the priest. The uninitiated enter with a
pleasurable sense of awe. Wisdom seems to admonish
them from her temple of text-books piled up solemnly in
the professional bookcase. There is an air of suave confidence
and quiet reserve about the room. Even the
usual Turkey carpet suggests comfortable sympathy and
the touch of the healing hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as it is unnatural to suspect a priest of the sins
he rebukes in others, so to the lay mind the physician
appears as a being above the diseases that he treats.
There is always something illogical in a doctor needing
his own physic. And yet of all men he is the last that
can boast of the bliss of ignorance. He knows the curses
that afflict man in the flesh, how grim and inevitable his
own end may be. He is too well aware of the malignant
significance of symptoms, and a month of dyspepsia may
reduce him to a state of morbid and half hypocondriacal
self-introspection. It is told of a great surgeon how he
lay awake all through one night imagining that he had
discovered an aneurism of his aorta. It is dangerous to
know too little, but on occasions it may be desperately
unpleasant to know too much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a serious and rather worried figure that moved
to and fro in the lofty room, as the March day drew towards
a dreary close. The house was silent, a depressing silence,
suggestive of stagnation and cynical melancholy. A fitful
wind set the tops of the cypress-trees swaying and
jerking in the garden. The only living thing visible from
Dr. Steel’s window was a black cat stalking birds under
the shadow of a bank of laurels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel had taken off his coat and folded it carefully
over the back of a chair. He stood by the window,
fumbling at his cuff-links, a preoccupied frown pinching
up the skin of his forehead above the thin, acquisitive
nose. After turning up his shirt-sleeves, he picked up a
pocket-lens from the table and focused the light upon
the forefinger of his right hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand that held the lense trembled very perceptibly.
On the right forefinger, immediately above the base of the
nail, a dull red papule stood out upon the skin. It was
clearly circumscribed in outline, and hard to the touch.
Parker Steel noticed all these details with the strained air
of a man scrutinizing an unpleasant statement of accounts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he laid the lens down on the flap of the
bureau by the window, and, unbuttoning his waistcoat,
passed his left hand under his shirt and vest. The deft
fingers half buried themselves in the hollow of his right
armpit. Parker Steel’s eyes had a peculiar, hard, staring
look, the expression seen in the eyes of the expert whose
whole intelligence is concentrated for the moment in the
sense of touch. His lower lip fell away slightly from his
teeth. Sharp lines of strain were visible upon his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words escaped from him involuntarily as he drew
his hand out from under his shirt. The smooth face had
grown suddenly haggard and sallow, and there was a
glint of ugly fear in the eyes. Parker Steel stood staring
at his hand, his mouth open, the lips softening as the lips
of a coward soften when his manhood melts before some
physical ordeal. The dapper figure has lost its alertness,
its neat and confident symmetry, and had become the
loose and slouching figure of a man suffering from shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel roused himself at last, forced back his
shoulders, and walked slowly towards the door. He turned
the key in the lock, and stood listening a moment before
picking up a hand-mirror from among the multifarious
books and papers on the table. Returning to the window,
he peered at the reflection of his own face, furtively, as
though dreading what he might discover. The sallow
skin was blemishless as yet. Not a spot or blur showed
from the line of the hair to the clean curve of the well-shaven
chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another minute Parker Steel was turning over the
leaves of his journal with impetuous fingers. He worked
back page by page, running a finger down each column of
names, stopping ever and again to recollect and reconsider.
It was on a page dated “February 12th” that he
discovered an entry that gave him the final pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Rattan, 10 Ford Street. Partus, 5 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.M.</span>”</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>A foot-note had been added at the bottom of the page,
a foot-note whose details were significant to the point of
proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel threw the book upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked round him like a man who has taken poison
unwittingly, and whose brain refuses to act under the
paralyzing pressure of fear. He, Parker Steel, a—!
Physician and egoist that he was, he could not bring himself
to think the word, to brand himself with the poor
fools who crowd the hospitals of great cities. The very
vision, a hundred visions such as he had seen in the
dingy “out-patient rooms” of old, made the instinct of
cleanliness in him sicken and recoil. For Parker Steel
had much of the delicate niceness of a cat. This sense
of unutterable pollution struck at his vanity and his self-respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved close to the window, and stood staring over
the wire blind into the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it not possible that he might be mistaken? He
could consult an expert. And yet in the inmost corners
of his heart he knew that the truth was merciless towards
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question threw him into a more desperate dilemma.
He remembered his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, his profession? He would have to abandon it
for one year, perhaps for two. And Parker Steel knew
that success in professional life is largely a matter of personality.
Withdraw that individual power, and the whole
structure, like the city of an Eastern fable, may melt
abruptly into mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baffled and irritated, a man with no great moral hold
on the deeper truths of life, he moved aimlessly about the
room, holding his right hand a little from him like one
with bleeding fingers, who fears the blood may stain
his clothes. The leather-padded consulting-chair stood
empty before the table. Parker Steel dropped into it by
the casual chance of habit, and sat staring dully at the
patterning of the paper on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the ordeal of an egoist unlightened by a signal
sense of self-abnegation or of public duty. Mercenary
motives and professional ambition prompted a compromise
at any hazard. The temptation to procrastinate
is ever with us, and the man of the polite world is the
most ingenious of sophists. For more than half an hour
Parker Steel sat silent and almost motionless in his chair.
When he at last left it, it was with the air of a man to
whom sanity, the sanity of the self-centred ego, had returned
after the hideous doubt and discord of a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wisest course was for him to temporize, seeing
that it was possible that he might be mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He recognized no immediate need for trusting any one
with mere suspicions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was he not a physician, and therefore wise as to all
precautions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for his wife? That was a problem that might have
to be considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of the front door closing roused him to the
needs of the impending present. He noticed to his surprise
that it was growing dark, and that the room was full
of deepening shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Dr. Steel in, Symons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his wife’s voice, and Parker Steel slipped into
his coat and unlocked the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tea nearly ready, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker, are you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I will be with you in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groped for a box of matches on the mantel-shelf and
lit the gas. Turning, he was startled by the reflection of
his own white face staring at him mistrustfully from the
mirror over the fire. It was as though Parker Steel shirked
the glance of his own eyes. He had a sense of unflattering
discomfort and deceit as he walked to a glass-fronted
cabinet fitted with drawers that stood in one
corner of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the middle of tea when Betty Steel glanced
at her husband’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you hurt yourself, Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Ah, the bathotic chilblain, of course! Has it
broken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband felt afraid behind his mask of casual indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have rasped the skin and got some dirt into
the place,” he said. “A mere nothing. I have just put
on this finger-stall. So you have heard that the De la
Mottes are leaving, eh? They were not much good in
the town, so far as the practice was concerned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s reply to his wife’s question had flashed
a suggestive gleam across his mind. Very probably it
was too late for him to defend her against himself. And
even if his fears proved true, he could swear absolute
ignorance as to the presence of the disease. No guilt
attached to him. He was merely striving to neutralize
the effects of a damnable and undeserved misfortune.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison, walking along the pavement
of Wilton High Street with the sharp, savage
strides of a man tortured by his own thoughts, turned
into Dr. Tugler’s surgery as the clock struck eight, finding
in this stern routine a power to steady him against
despair. He slipped off his overcoat, folded it slowly
and methodically over the back of a bench, and hung his
hat on one of the gas brackets projecting from the wall.
To John Tugler, who was seated at one of the tables,
examining a girl with a red rash covering her face, there
was something in the big man’s slow and restrained
patience that betrayed how sorrow was shadowing his
assistant’s home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler pushed back his chair, and crossed the
room to the corner where Murchison was bending over
his open instrument bag. The droop of the shoulders,
the whole pose of the powerful figure, told of the burden
that lay heavy upon the father’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face that met John Tugler’s was haggard and
stupid with two sleepless nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—worse,” and he snapped the bag to with an
irritable closure of the hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler looked at him as he might have looked
at a refractory friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now, Murchison, you’re feeling damned bad.
Knock off to-day. Stileman and I can manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I must work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It helps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like punching something when you’re savage. Perhaps
you’re right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tugler returned to the girl with the red rash, while
Murchison passed on to the surgery, where some half-score
patients were waiting to be treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning,” and he glanced round him like a
man in a hurry; “first case. Well, how’s the leg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scraggy, undersized individual with a narrow, swarthy
face was pulling up a trousers leg with two dirty, drug-stained
hands. He was a worker in a chemical factory,
and his ugly, harsh, and suspicious features seemed to
have taken the low moral stamp of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No worse, doct’r.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No worse! Well, have you been resting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half an’ half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so. You may as well come here and grumble
for months unless you do what we tell you. It is
quite useless continuing like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent down and began to unwind the dirty bandage
from the man’s leg. The chemical worker expanded
the broad nostrils of his carnivorous nose, sniffed,
and cocked a battered bowler onto the back of his
head. Manners were not mended in Dr. Tugler’s surgery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s truth, doct’r, easy with it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison had stripped a sodden pad of lint and
plaster from the ulcer on the man’s leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense; that didn’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg to differ, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you dress this last?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The patient hesitated, eying Murchison sulkily as
though tempted to be insolent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak the truth and say three days ago. You’re on
your ‘club’—of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s the harm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you don’t trouble much how long you draw club-money,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s your business, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My business, is it? Well, my friend, you carry out
my instructions or there will be trouble about the certificate.
You understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man cast an evil look at Murchison’s broad back
as he turned to spread boracic ointment on clean lint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know as how I come here to hear your sauce,”
he remarked, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison faced him with an irritable glitter of the
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose some of us poor fellows cost you gentlemen
too much in tow and flannel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are just a little at sea, my friend. What
we do is to prevent the Friendly Societies being imposed
upon by loafers. Dress your leg every day. Rest it,
you understand, and keep out of the pubs. You had
better come by some manners before next week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chemical worker snarled out some vague retort,
and then relapsed into silence. Such shufflers had no
pity from James Murchison. He was in no mood that
morning to bear with the impertinences of malingerers
and humbugs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock struck eleven before the last patient passed
out into Wilton High Street with its thundering drays
and clanging trams. Murchison had done the work of
two men in the surgery that morning, silent, skilful, and
determined, a man who worked that the savage smart of
sorrow might be soothed and assuaged thereby. With
the women and the children he was very gentle and very
patient. His hands were never rough and never clumsy.
Perhaps none of the people whose wounds he dressed
guessed how bitter a wound was bleeding in the heart of
this sad-eyed, patient-faced man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler sidled in when Murchison had pinned up
the last bandage. He swung the door to gently, sighed,
and pretended to examine the entries in the ledger. Murchison
was washing his hands at the sink, staring hard at
the water as it splashed from the tap upon his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much visiting to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll hire a cab, and drive down to Black End. Most
of them seem to lie that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was looking for a clean place in the roller-towel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can manage the visiting down there,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler surveyed him attentively over a fat shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll knock up, old man,” he remarked, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison started. The familiarity had a touch of
tenderness that lifted it from its vulgar setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very bad, is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comatose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, damn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man whipped over the leaves of the ledger,
as though looking for something that he could not find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems a beastly shame,” he said, presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, this sort of smash-up of a youngster’s life. They
call it Providence, or the Divine Will, or something of
that sort, don’t they? Must say I can’t stick that sort
of bosh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was wringing his hands fiercely in the folds
of the rough towel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a natural judgment, I suppose,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A judgment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my fault that the child ever came here. It
need not have been so—” and he broke off with a savage
twisting of the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Tugler ran one finger slowly across a blank space
in the ledger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take it that way,” he said, slowly; “it doesn’t
help a man to curse himself because a damned bug of a
bacillus breeds in this holy horror of a town. Curse the
British Constitution, the law-mongers, or the local money
shufflers who’d rather save three farthings than clean
their slums.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison was silent. Yet in his heart there
burned the fierce conviction that the father’s frailty had
been visited upon the innocent body of the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four o’clock had struck, and the houses were casting
long shadows across the waters of the canal, before Murchison
turned in at the gate of Clovelly after three
hours visiting in the Wilton slums. He let himself in
silently with his latch-key, hung his hat and coat in the
hall, and entered the little front room where tea was laid
on the imitation walnut table. On the sofa by the window
he found Catherine asleep, her head resting against
the wall. It was as though sheer weariness, the spell of
many sleepless nights, had fallen on her, and that but
a momentary slacking of her self-control had suffered
nature to assert her sway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison stood looking at his wife in silence. Sleep
had wiped out much of the sorrow from her face, and she
seemed beautiful as Beatrice dreaming strange dreams
upon the walls of heaven. A stray strand of March sunlight
had woven itself into her hair. Her hands lay open
beside her on the sofa, open, palms upward, with a
quaint suggestion of trustfulness and appeal. To Murchison
it seemed that if God but saw her thus, such
prayers as she had uttered would be answered out of pity
for the brave sweetness of her womanhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If peace lingered in sleep, there would be sorrow in her
waking. Murchison was loath to recall her to the world
of coarse reality and unpitying truth. A great tenderness,
a strong man’s tenderness for a woman and a wife,
softened his face as he watched the quiet drawing of her
breath. And yet what ultimate kindness could there be
in such delay? Life and death are but the counterparts
of day and night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine awoke with a touch of her husband’s hand
upon her cheek. She sighed, put out her arms to him,
a consciousness of pain vivid at once upon her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hands up to her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never meant to sleep. What a long day you must
have had!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better that I should work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same; I can see no change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine rose with a suggestion of effort, and leaned
for a moment on her husband’s arm. The impulse seemed
simultaneous with them, the impulse that drew them to
the room above. They went up together, hand in hand,
silent and restrained, two souls awed by the mysteries of
death and life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the bed by the window lay Gwen, with childishly
open yet sightless eyes. A flush of vivid color showed on
either cheek, her golden hair falling aside like waves of
light about her forehead. Her breathing was tranquil
and feeble, and spaced out with a peculiar rhythm. The
pupils of the eyes were markedly unequal; one lid drooped
slightly, and the right angle of the red mouth was a little
drawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a certain pitiful semblance of health that mocks
the heart in many such cases. Children who die thus are
often beautiful. They seem to sleep with open eyes.
The flush on the cheeks has nothing of the gathering grayness
of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine, bending low, looked at Gwen with the long
look of one who will not see the vanishing torch of
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is still asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s voice was a tearless echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James, it can’t be. Look, what a color! And the
eyes—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison laid a hand gently on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know; I have seen such things before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she will wake presently?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. This long sleep will do her good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will not wake for us, wife,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not wake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine’s eyes were incredulous, full of the intenseness
of a mother’s love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look—look at her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the pity of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall not hear her speak again; she will never
see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why? I cannot believe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, it is death—the way some children die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood silent, side by side. Then Catherine bent
low; child’s mouth and mother’s mouth met in a long
dream kiss. There was a sound of broken, troubled
whispering in the room, a sound as of inarticulate tenderness
and wordless prayer. Murchison’s right hand covered
his face. His wife’s eyes and cheeks were wet with
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bowed herself over the child, and did not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, these last hours, they are so precious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her mutely, put a hand to his throat, and
turned away. It was too solemn, too poignant a scene
for him to outrage it with words. Gwen, dead in life,
would see her mother’s face no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was on the stairs when the blare of a tin
trumpet seemed to hurt the silence of the little house.
An impatient fist was beating a tattoo on the front door.
It was the boy Jack come home from school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s mouth quivered, and then hardened. He
went to the door, and opened it to a blast of the boy’s
trumpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, I say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strong hand twisted the toy from the boy’s fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Murchison’s mouth gaped. He looked at his
father’s face, wonderingly, grievedly, and was awed into
a frightened silence, child egoist that he was, by the expression
in his father’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison pointed to the sitting-room door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy obeyed, sullen and a little stupefied. His
father closed and locked the door on him, and then passed
out into the space behind the house that they called a
garden. A few crocuses were gilding the sour, black
earth. They were flowers that Gwen had planted before
Christmas-time. And Murchison, as he looked at them,
thought that she should take them in her little hands to
the Great Father of all Children.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee sat crying at the breakfast-table
over a letter that she held in her fat, white hand.
It was a letter from Catherine, and told of the last resting-place
of Gwen, a narrow bed of clay amid white headstones
on the Wilson hills. She had been reading the
letter aloud to her brother, whose face was a study in the
irritable suppression of his feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn that bird!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canary in its cage by the window was filling the
room with shivers of shrill sound. Porteus pushed his
chair back, jerked an antimacassar from the sofa, and
flung it over the bird’s cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, dear, go on. I am expecting Dixon to see
me in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee wiped her spectacles, and blundered
on brokenly through the letter. There were eight pages,
closely written, and whether it was the indistinctness of
Catherine’s writing, or the dimness of Miss Carmagee’s
eyes, the old lady’s progress was sluggish in the extreme.
She had forgotten to add milk to her untasted cup of tea,
and the rashers of bacon on her plate were congealing
into unappetizing grease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus sat fidgeting at the far end of the table. The
vitality of his interest betrayed itself in a frowning and
jerky spirit of impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what are they going to do now, eh? Stay on
and lose the boy? Murchison ought to have more sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee’s eyes had assumed an expression of
moist surprise behind her spectacles. She appeared to
be digesting some unexpected piece of news in silence,
and with the amiable forgetfulness of a lethargic mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus had handed her his empty cup. Some seconds
elapsed before his sister noticed the intrusion of the
china.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, what a coincidence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the cup and filled it mechanically, her eyes
still fixed upon the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only it had happened earlier, the money would have
been of use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Porteus betrayed the natural impatience of the
energetic male.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul, are you contriving a monopoly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee lifted her mild spectacles to her brother’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Pentherby is dead,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No extreme loss to the community. Ah—would
you—!” and he cast a threatening glance in the direction
of the bird-cage at the sound of an insinuating “tweet.”
“Well, what about the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer’s eyes twinkled as though Mrs. Pentherby’s
dividends were more interesting than her person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has left nearly all her money and her furniture
to Catherine. She died the very same day as Gwen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pity it wasn’t six months ago. The old lady had some
first-class china, and a few fine pictures. Does Catherine
say how much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much what, Porteus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money, my dear, money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think she says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother pushed back his chair, and glanced briskly
at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take it with me,” he said, stretching out a brown
and energetic hand for the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t quite finished it, Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind; there’s your breakfast getting cold.
You had better have some fresh tea made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister surrendered the letter with a spirit of amiable
self-negation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The money ought to make a difference to them,” she
said, softly, taking off her spectacles and wiping them
with slow, pensive hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money always makes a difference, my dear, especially
when people are heroically proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Phyllis Carmagee’s thoughts were towards that
gray-skied, slaving, sordid town where Gwen was buried,
as she sipped her tea and looked at her brother’s empty
chair. She was a woman whom many of her neighbors
thought stolid and reserved, a woman not gifted with great
powers of self-expression. Friendship with many is a mere
gratification of the social ego. The vivacious people who
delight in conversationalism, take pleasure in those personalities
that are new and pleasing for the moment, even
as they are interested in new and complex flowers. To
Phyllis Carmagee, however, her friends had more of the
enduring dearness of familiar trees. They were part of
her consciousness, part of her daily and her yearly life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus’s sister came by an idea as she sat alone at the
breakfast-table that morning. Serene and obese natures
are slow in conceiving, yet the concept may have the
greater stability for the very slowness of the progress.
The crystallization of that idea went on all day, till it was
ready to be displayed in its completeness to her brother
as he dined. Miss Carmagee had decided to go down
to Wilton, and to show that her friendship was worth a
long day’s journey. A sentimental and unctuous letter
would have sufficed for a mere worldling. But Porteus
Carmagee’s sister had that rare habit of being loyal and
sincere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see the child’s grave,” she said, quietly,
her round, white face very soft and gentle in the light of
the shaded lamp; “it seems hard to realize that the little
thing is dead. Gwen meant so much to her father. I
wonder what they are going to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee stared hard at the silver epergne
full of daffodils before him on the table. They were at
dessert, and alone, with the curtains drawn, and a wood
fire burning in the old-fashioned grate. The whole setting
of the room spoke of a generation that was past. It
suggested solidity and repose, placid kindliness, prosaic
comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murchison ought never to have left us,” said the
lawyer, curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The affair might have blown over in a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so, Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he had only stuck to his guns. People always wait
to see what a man will do. If he skedaddles they draw
their own inferences. Life is largely a game of bluff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of brother and sister met in a sudden questioning
glance. Possibly the same thought had occurred
to both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it be possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possible for what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For James Murchison to come back to Roxton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer reached for his napkin that had slipped
down from his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the question,” he confessed, “it is not easy to
rebuild a reputation. I would rather face fire than the
sneers of my genteel neighbors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee’s placid face had lost its habitual air
of contentment and repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it would require courage,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People would probably call it impertinence. It requires
more than courage to be successfully impertinent
in this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cleverness, Porteus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Genius, the genius of patience, magnanimity, and
self-restraint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister pondered a moment, while Porteus sipped
his port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—there is Catherine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother’s keen eyes lit up at the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there we have a touch of the divine fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She could help him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next to God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence again between them for a season.
The dim and homely room seemed full of a quiet dignity,
a pervading restfulness that was clean and good. The
most prosaic people grow great and lovable when their
hearts are moved to succor others. The words of a beggar
may strike the noblest chords of time, and live with
the utterances of martyrs and of prophets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Porteus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother and sister looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might speak to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, dear, better than any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if they need money? Mrs. Pentherby’s property
cannot come to them at once. The law—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus’s face twinkled benignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law, like a mule, is abominably slow. If I can
be of any use to them—remind Kate that I am still alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee regarded her brother affectionately
across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall go to-morrow,” she said, with a quiet
sigh.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>An increased sallowness and a slight thinning of the
hair were the only changes that might have been
noticed in Parker Steel that spring. The characteristic
symptoms had been slight and evanescent, the “rash” so
faint and transient that a delicate dusting of powder had
hidden it even from Mrs. Betty’s eyes. A few of his most
intimate friends had noticed that Parker Steel had the
tense, strained look of a man suffering from overwork.
That he had given up his nightly cigar and his wine,
pointed also to the fact that the physician had knowledge
of his own needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such a man as Steel the zest of life lay in the energetic
stir and ostentatious bustle of success. His conceit
was in his cleverness, in the smartness of his equipage
and reputation, and in the flattering gossip that haunts
a healer’s name. Parker Steel was essentially a selfish
mortal, and selfish men are often the happiest, provided
they succeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet no man, however selfish, can wholly stifle his own
thoughts. That the silence he kept was an immoral
silence, no man knew better than did Parker Steel. People
would have shrunk from him had they known the
truth, as a refined woman shrinks from the offensive
carcass of a drunken tramp. His own niceness of taste
revolted from the consciousness of chance and undeserved
pollution. Ambition was strong in him, however, and
the cold tenacity to hold what he had gained. More
isolated than Selkirk on his island, he had to bear the bitterness
of it alone, knowing that sympathy was locked
out by silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The supreme trying of his powers of hypocrisy came for
him in his attitude towards his wife. Parker Steel was
in no sense an uxorious fellow, and neither he nor Betty
were ever demonstrative towards each other. An occasional
half-perfunctory meeting of the lips had satisfied
both after the first year of marriage. For this reason
Parker Steel’s ordeal was less complex and severe than
if he had had to repulse an emotional and warm-blooded
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first diplomatic development had been insomnia;
at least that was the excuse he made to Betty when he
chose to sleep alone in his dressing-room at the back of
the house. The faintest sound disturbed him, so he protested,
and the rattle of wheels over the cobbles of the
Square kept him irritably sleepless in the early hours of
the morning. To Betty Steel there was no inconsistency
in the excuse he gave. She thought him worried and
overworked, and there was abundant justification for the
latter evil. Winter and early spring are the briskest
seasons of a doctor’s life. Dr. Steel had had seven severe
cases of pneumonia on his list one week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too much in demand, Parker,” she had said.
“There is always the possibility of a partner to be considered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, no; I am not a believer in a co-operative
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must take a jaunt somewhere as soon as the work
slackens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in good time, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sicily is fashionable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel had indulged in optimistic reflections to
distract her vigilance. She had sought to prove that he
was in stale health by remarking that the wound on his
forefinger had not completely healed. He was still wearing
the finger-stall that covered the <span class='it'>fons et origo mali</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is absolutely no need for you to fuss about me,”
he had answered; “I am not made of iron, and the work
tells. Three thousand a year is not earned without
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As much as that, Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had touched a susceptible passion in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps more. We shall be able to call our own tune
before we are five-and-forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven defend us, Parker, you hint at terrible things.
Respectable obesity, and morning prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband had laughed, and given her plausible
comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be more dangerous then than you are now,”
he had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, their fortunes were very much in the ascendant,
and the social side of professional life had prospered
in Mrs. Betty’s hands. The brunette was supreme in
Roxton so far as beauty was concerned, supreme also in
the yet more magic elements of graceful <span class='it'>savoir-faire</span> and
tact. She was one of those women who had learned to
charm by flattery without seeming to be a sycophant;
moreover, she had tested the wisdom of propitiating her
own sex by appearing even more amiable to women than
to men. Since the passing of the Murchisons she had
had nothing in the way of rivalry to fear. True, two
“miserable squatters” had put up brass plates in the
town, and scrambled for some of the poorer of James Murchison’s
patients. Mrs. Betty had been able to call upon
the wives with patronizing magnanimity. They were both
rather dusty, round-backed ladies, with no pretensions to
style, either in their own persons or in the persons of their
husbands. One of these professional gentlemen, a huge
and flat-faced Paddy, resembled a police constable in
plain clothes. The other was rather a meek young man
in glasses, destitute of any sense of humor, and very useful
in the Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roxton had weathered Lent and Easter, and Lady
Sophia Gillingham, Dame President of the local habitation
of the Primrose League; patroness of all Roxton
charities, Dissenting enterprises excepted; and late lady-in-waiting
to the Queen; had called her many dear friends
together to discuss the coming Midsummer Bazaar that
was held annually for the benefit of the Roxton Cottage
Hospital. Roxton, like the majority of small country
towns, was a veritable complexity of cliques, and by
“Roxton” should be understood the superior people who
were Unionists in politics, and Church Christians in religion.
There were also Chapel Christians in Roxton,
chiefly of Radical persuasion, and therefore hardly decent
in the sight of the genteel. People of “peculiar views”
were rare, and not generally encouraged. Some of the
orthodox even refused to buy a local tradesman’s boots,
because that particular tradesman was not a believer in
the Trinity. The inference is obvious that the “Roxton”
concerned in Lady Sophia’s charitable bazaar, was
superior and highly cultured Roxton, the Roxton of dinner-jackets
and distinction, equipages, and Debrett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be a very dear friend of Lady Sophia Gillingham’s
was to be one of the chosen and elect of God, and Betty
Steel had come by that supreme and angelic exaltation.
Perhaps Mignon’s kitten had purred and gambolled Mrs.
Betty into favor; more probably the physician’s wife had
nothing to learn from any cat. Betty Steel and her husband
dined frequently at Roxton Priory. The brunette
had even reached the unique felicity of being encouraged
in informal and unexpected calls. Lady Sophia possessed
a just and proper estimate of her own social position.
She was fat, commonplace, and amiable, poorly educated,
a woman of few ideas. But she was Lady Sophia Gillingham,
and would have expected St. Peter to give her proper
precedence over mere commoners in the anteroom of
heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third Thursday after Easter Mrs. Betty Steel
drove homeward in a radiant mood, with the spirit of
spring stolen from the dull glint of a fat old lady’s eyes.
There had been an opening committee meeting, and
Lady Sophia had expressed it to be her wish that Mrs.
Steel should be elected secretary. Moreover, the production
of a play had been discussed, a pink muslin drama
suited to the susceptibilities of the Anglican public. The
part of heroine had been offered, not unanimously, to Mrs.
Betty. And with a becoming spirit of diffidence she had
accepted the honor, when pressed most graciously by the
Lady Sophia’s own prosings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty might have impersonated April as she
swept homeward under the high beneficence of St.
Antonia’s elms. The warmth of worldly well-being
plumps out a woman’s comeliness. She expands and
ripens in the sun of prosperity and praise, in contrast to
the thousands of the ever-contriving poor, whose sordid
faces are but the reflection of sordid facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s face had an April alluringness that day;
its outlines were soft and beautiful, suggestive of the
delicacy of apple bloom seen through morning mist. She
was exceeding well content with life, was Mrs. Betty,
for her husband was in a position to write generous
checks, and the people of Roxton seemed ready to pay
her homage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel was reading in the dining-room when this
triumphant and happy lady came in like a white flower
rising from a sheath of green. It was only when selfishly
elated that the wife showed any flow of affection for her
husband. For the once she had the air of an enthusiastic
girl whom marriage had not robbed of her
ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old Parker—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went towards him with an out-stretching of the
hands, as he dropped the <span class='it'>Morning Post</span>, and half rose
from the lounge chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had a good time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite splendid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swooped towards him, not noticing the furtive yet
watchful expression in her husband’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a kiss, old <span class='it'>Morning Post</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Madam Sophia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most affable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel had caught her out-stretched hands. It
was as though he were afraid of touching his wife’s lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Making conquests, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waal—I guess that”—and she spoke through her
nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enticing them into the family pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in her husband’s eyes touched Betty Steel
beneath her vivacity and easy persiflage. Her husband
had risen from his chair, released her hands, and moved
away towards the fire. She had a sudden instinct telling
her that he was not glad of her return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife’s airiness was damped instantly. Parker
Steel had repelled her with the semi-playful air of a man
not wishing to be bothered. She had noticed this suggestion
of aloofness much in him of late, and had ascribed
it to irritability, the result of overwork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything the matter, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her frankly, with arched brows and open
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you seem tired—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is some excuse for me. This is the first ten
minutes I have had to myself—all day. It is an effort to
talk when one’s tongue has been going for hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife’s face appeared a little <span class='it'>triste</span> and peevish.
She glanced at herself in the mirror over the mantel-piece,
and found herself wondering why life seemed composed
of actions and reactions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you had tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I waited,” and he turned and rang the bell with
a feeling of relief. It was trying to his watchfulness for
Parker Steel to be left alone with his own wife. Even the
white cap of the parlor-maid was welcome to him, or the
flimsiest barrier that could aid him in his ordeal of silent
self-isolation. The art of hypocrisy grows more complex
with each new statement of relationships. And
hypocrisy in the home is the reguilding of a substance
that tarnishes with every day. The wear and tear of
life erase the lying surface, and the daily daubing becomes
a habit by necessity, even as a single dying of the hair
pledges the vain mortal to perpetual self-decoration.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There were many men in Wilton who had looked
at their children’s graves, little banks of green turf
ranged on the hill-side where the winds wailed in winter
like the mythical spirits of the damned. A gaunt, graceless
place, this cemetery, a place where the insignificant
dead lived only in the few notches of a mason’s chisel
upon stone. A high yellow brick wall encompassed its
many acres. Immediately within the iron gates stood
a tin chapel, a building that might have stood for the
Temple of Ugliness, the deity of commercialized towns.
On either side of the main walk a row of sickly aspens
lifted their slender branches against a hueless sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the man and the woman who stood in one corner of
this burial-ground, looking down upon a grave that had
been but lately banked with turf, there was an infinite and
sordid sadness in the scene. Two graves, not ten yards
away, had been filled in but the day before, and the grass
was caked and stained with yellow clay. Near them stood
the black wooden shelter used by the officiating priest in
dirty weather. A few wreaths, sodden, rain-drenched,
the flowers already turning brown, seemed to mock the
hands that had placed them there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>White headstones everywhere; a few obelisks; a few
plain wooden crosses; rank mounds where no name lingered
after death. Ever and again the thin clink of the
hopeless chapel bell. A gray sky merging into a wet,
gray landscape. In the valley—Wilton, prostrate under
mist and smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison, standing bareheaded before Gwen’s
grave, gazed at the wet turf with the eyes of a man who
saw more beneath it than mere lifeless clay. There was
nothing of rebellion in the pose of the tall figure—rather,
the slight stoop of one poring over some rare book with
the reverence of him who reads to learn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Catherine there was no consciousness of penance
as she stood beside him, silent and distant-eyed. Her
hands were clasped together under her cloak. She stood
as one waiting, heart heavy, yet ready to awake to the
new life that opens even for those who grieve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were not a few such groups scattered about this
upland burial-ground, colorless, subdued figures seen
dimly through the drizzling mist of rain. Quite near to
Murchison a working-man was arranging a few flowers
in a large white jam-pot; the grave, by the name on the
headstone, was the grave of his wife. A few children,
who had wandered up to see some funeral, were playing
“touch wood” between the aspens of the main walk.
There was an irresponsible callousness in their shrill,
slum-hardened voices. To them this place of Death was
but a field to play in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison had turned from Gwen’s grave, and was
looking at his wife. There seemed some bond more
sacred between them now that they had shared both life
and death in the body of their child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are cold, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched her cheek with his hand as he turned up
the collar of her cloak. Her hair was wet and a-glisten
with the rain, her face cold like the face of one fresh from
the breath of an autumn sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only my skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wind is keen, though. It is time we turned back
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, my child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the words in a whisper as they moved away
from the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before them, seen dimly through a haze of rain, lay
the colliery town, a vague splash of darkness in the valley.
Here and there a tall chimney stood trailing smoke,
or the faint glow of a fire gave a thin opalescence to the
shell of mist. Sounds, faint and far, yet full of the significance
of labor, drifted up the bleak slopes of the hillside,
like the sounds from ships sailing a foggy sea. The
rattle of a train, the shriek of a steam-whistle, the slow
strokes of some great clock striking the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James Murchison’s eyes were fixed upon this town beside
the pit mouths, this pool of poverty and toil, where
the eddies of effort never ceased upon the surface. It
was strange to him, this colliery town, and yet familiar.
Always would his manhood yearn towards it because of
the dear dead, even though its memories were hateful to
him, full of the bitterness of ignominy and pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gwen’s death had come to Murchison as a sudden
silence, a strange void in the hurrying entities of life. It
was as though the passing of this child had changed the
phenomena of existence for him, and given a new rhythm
to the pulse of Time. He had become aware of a new
setting to life, even as a man who has walked the same
road day by day discovers on some winter dawn a fresh
and unearthly beauty in the scene. He felt an unsolved
newness in his being, a solemnity such as those who have
looked upon the dead must feel. And no strong nature
can pass through such a phase without creating inward
energy and power. Sorrow, like winter, may be but a
season of repose, troubled and drear perhaps, but moving
towards the miracle of spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilton cemetery, with its zinc-roofed chapel, its yellow
walls and iron gates, lay behind them, while the dim
horizon ran in a gray blur along the hills. Husband and
wife walked for a time in silence, for each had a burden
of deep thought to bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the man who spoke first, quietly, and with restraint,
and yet with something of the fierce spirit of an
outcast Cain visible upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been thinking of what I said to you last
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was looking at him with a brave clearness of the
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose sensible people would call such a venture—mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are often strongest, dear, when we are most mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung on beside her, his eyes at gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The madness of a forlorn hope. No, it is not that.
I have not any of the impudence of the adventurer. It
is something more solemn, more grim, more for a final
end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved, I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you not afraid for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand under his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God give us both courage, dear,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached the outskirts of Wilton, and the
ugliness of the place was less visible in these outworks
of the town. The streets had something of the quaintness
of antiquity about them, for this was a part of the
real Wilton, an old English townlet that had been gripped
and strangled by the decapod of the pits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About your mother’s money, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rumble of a passing van compelled silence for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must retain the whole control.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard a woman’s unwillingness in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my wish, dear. I shall need a certain sum to
start with, but my life-insurance can be made a security
for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“James!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face reproached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we so little married that what is mine is not yours
also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is because you are my wife, Kate, that I consider
these things. Your mother was wise, though her instructions
do not flatter me. Legally, I cannot touch a
single penny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked troubled, and a little impatient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall hate the money—if—no, I don’t mean that.
But, dear,” and she drew very close to him in the twilight
of the streets, “it will make no difference. You will not
feel—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feel, Kate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That it is mine, and not yours. You know, dear,
what I mean. I don’t want to think—to think that you
will feel as though you had to ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked, man and wife, into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall ask, Kate, because—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are what you are. It will not hurt me to remember
that the stuff is yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, quite an hour ago a battered and moth-eaten cab
had deposited a stout lady on the doorstep of Clovelly.
The stout lady had a round white face that beamed sympathetically
from under the arch of a rather grotesque
bonnet. A girl, hired for the month, and dressed in a
makeshift black frock, had opened the door three inches
to Miss Carmagee. There had been a confidential discussion
between these two, the girl letting the gap between
door and door-post increase before the lady in the grotesque
bonnet. The doctor and the “missus” were out,
and Master Jack having tea at a friend’s house in the
next street. So much Miss Carmagee had learned before
she had been admitted to the little front room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite dusk when Catherine and her husband
turned in at the garden gate. The blinds were down, the
gas lit. Murchison opened the front door with his key,
remembering, as he ever remembered, the golden head
that would shine no more for him in that diminutive,
dreary house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was hanging his coat on a peg in the passage, when
he heard a sharp cry from Catherine, who had entered
the front room. There was the rustling of skirts, the sound
of an inarticulate greeting between two eager friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could have doubted Miss Carmagee’s solid
identity. She was resting her hands on Catherine’s
shoulders. They had kissed each other like mother and
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, when did you come? We had no letter. James,
James—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison found them holding hands. There were
tears in Miss Carmagee’s mild blue eyes. Warned of
her coming, he might have shirked the meeting with the
pride of a man too sensitive towards the past. But Miss
Carmagee in the flesh, motherly and very gentle, with
Catherine’s kisses warm upon her face, stood for nothing
that was critical, or chilling to the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met her with open hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have taken us by surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Phyllis’s eyes were on the sad, memory-shadowed
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to come,” and her voice failed her a little. “I
sha’n’t worry you; we are old friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put up her benign and ugly face, as though the
privilege of a mother belonged to her by nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have felt it all so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flash of infinite yearning leaped up and passed in the
man’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be tired,” he said, clinging to commonplaces.
“Have they sent your luggage up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee sank into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left it at the hotel. I’m not going to be a
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—but we must have you here. James—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” and the substantial nature of the old lady’s
person seemed to become evident, “I insist on sleeping
there to-night. Now, humor me, or I shall feel myself
a nuisance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee’s solidity of will made her contention
impregnable. Moreover, the common-sense view she
took of the matter boasted a large element of discretion.
People who live in a small house on one hundred and
sixty pounds a year cannot be expected to be prepared
for social emergencies. Even a philosopher is limited
by the contents of his larder, and Miss Carmagee was one
of those excellent women whose philosophy takes note
of the trivial things of life—pots, pans, and linen, the cold
end of mutton, a rice-pudding to supply three. It is truly
regrettable that a man’s Promethean spirit should be
bound down by such contemptible trifles. Yet a tactful
refusal to share a suet-pudding may be worth more than
the wittiest epigram ever made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee and Catherine spent an hour alone
together that evening, for Murchison had patients waiting
for him at Dr. Tugler’s surgery in Wilton High Street.
Master Jack had returned from his tea-party, to be
hugged, presented with a box of soldiers, a clasp-knife,
and a prayer-book, and then hurried off to bed. The soldiers
and the knife shared the sheets with him; the prayer-book
(amiable aunts forgive!) was left derelict under an
arm-chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the great event that night for these two women,
such contrasts and yet so alike in the deeper things of
the soul, came with that communing together before the
fire, the lights turned low, the room in shadow. It was
somewhile before Miss Carmagee approached the purpose
that had brought her across England with bag
and baggage. She was a woman of tact, and it is not
easy to be a partisan at times without wounding those
whom we wish to help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elder woman had hardly broached the subject,
before Catherine, sitting on a cushion beside Miss Carmagee’s
chair, turned from the fire-light with an eager
lifting of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it was only yesterday that James spoke to me
of such a plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To return to us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and win back what he lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee saw her way more clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, child, you have many friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and your husband also. Porteus and I discussed
the matter. You must not think us busybodies,
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A kiss was the surest answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid when James first spoke of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” and she colored; “it was cowardly of me, but I
remembered how we left the place. It will be an ordeal.
We shall have to walk through fire together. But
still—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, child,” and Miss Carmagee let her have her
say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, there is a greatness in the plan that takes my
heart. We women love our husbands to be brave. I
know what it will mean to James. He says that many
people will think him mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee sat stroking one of Catherine’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the right kind of madness,” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To rise above public opinion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, when we are in the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat for a while in silence, looking into the fire,
Catherine’s head against Miss Carmagee’s shoulder.
Above, in the nursery, Jack Murchison was trying his
new knife on the rail of a bedroom chair. He had crept
out of bed, rummaged up some matches, and lit the gas.
The boy had no eyes for the empty cot in the far corner
of the room. He had not yet grasped what the loss of a
life in the home meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to promise me something, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee’s hand touched the mother’s hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to tell me frankly—about the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine looked up into the benign, white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, dear, that there is a lot of dusting and polishing
to be done before the lawyers allow people to step
into their own shoes. I have a pair that I could lend
you for a year or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine smiled at the simile, despite the occasion.
Miss Carmagee’s shoes were as large and generous as her
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too good of you. They tell me I have inherited
property that will bring in an income of seven to eight
hundred a year. I don’t think—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we could let you be so generous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee leaned forward in her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Generous? It is not generous, dear; a mere matter
of convenience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You call it merely ‘convenience’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child, I ought to call it a blessing to me, a true
blessing. Don’t you understand that it would make me
very happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How good and kind you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, dear, nonsense.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gehogan, the gentleman from Ireland who
had attempted to possess himself of the scatterings
of James Murchison’s practice, had discovered no proper
spirit of appreciation in Roxton, and as though to register
his displeasure, had departed abruptly, so abruptly that
he had left behind him many unpaid bills. The house
in Lombard Street had held him and his progeny for
some seasons, and the family had left its mark upon the
place in more instances than one. Miss Carmagee and
her brother, who went over the house for some unexplained
reason, concluded that clean paint and paper,
and many scrubbings with soap and water, were needed
for the effacement of an atmosphere of mediæval sanctity.
The charwoman averred—an excellent authority—that the
late tenant had kept pigs in a shed at the end of the
garden, and had salted and stored the bacon in the bath.
The house itself had been left littered with all sorts of
rubbish. Dr. Gehogan’s youngsters had turned the
back garden into a species of pleasaunce by the sea.
There was a big puddle in the middle of the lawn, and
oyster-shells, broken bricks, and jam-jars had accumulated
to an extraordinary extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the end of April such people of observation as
passed down Lombard Street, discovered that the great
red-brick house was preparing for new tenants. Mr.
Clayton, the decorator, had hung his professional board
from the central first-floor window. Sashes were being
repainted white, the front door an æsthetic green. Paper-hangers
were at work in the chief rooms, and whitewash
brushes splashed and flapped in the kitchen quarters.
Questioned by interested fellow-tradesmen as to the
name and nature of the incoming tenant, Mr. Clayton
blinked and confessed his ignorance. He was working
under Mr. Porteus Carmagee’s orders. Mr. Clayton
had even heard that the house had changed hands, and
that the lawyer had bought it from the late owner, but
whether it was let, Mr. Clayton could not tell. Even
Mr. Beasely, the local house-agent, was no wiser in the
matter. Speculation remained possible, while the more
pushing of the local tradesmen were ready at any moment
to tout for the new-comers’ “esteemed patronage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon early in May a large furniture van,
manœuvring to and fro in Lombard Street and absorbing
the whole road, compelled a stylish carriage and pair
to come to a sharp halt. The carriage was Dr. Parker
Steel’s, and it contained his wife, a complacent study in
pink, with a pert little white hat perched on a most elaborate
yet seemingly simple coiffure. The footway opposite
the Murchison’s old house was littered with straw,
and stray odds and ends of furniture, while two men in
green baize aprons were struggling up the steps with a
Chesterfield sofa. Through one of the open windows of
the dining-room, Betty Steel’s sharp eyes caught sight of
Miss Carmagee, rigged up in a white apron and unpacking
china with the help of one of her maids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The furniture van had made port, and Parker Steel’s
carriage rolled on into St. Antonia’s Square. Mrs.
Betty’s eyes had clouded a little under her Paris hat, for
unpleasant thoughts are invariably suggested by the faces
of people who do not love us. The ego in self-conscious
mortals is sensitive as a piece of smoked-glass. The
passing of the faintest shadow is registered upon its
surface, and its lustre may be dimmed by a chance
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This house in Lombard Street had never lost for Betty
Steel its suggestion of passive hostility. Its associations
always stirred the energies of an unforgotten hate, and
though triumphant, she often found herself frowning
when she passed the place. Moreover, Miss Carmagee
had been the other woman’s friend, and in life there can
be no neutrality when rivals fight for survival in the business
of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel had come from the orchards that were white
about Roxton Priory, yet the glimpse of the stir and
movement in that red-brick house had blown the May-bloom
from her thoughts. Did Kate Murchison ever
wish herself back in Lombard Street? What had become
of her and her children? Betty Steel woke from a moment’s
reverie as the carriage drew up before her own
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elderly parlor-maid, five feet of starch, to say
nothing of the cap, opened the front door to Mrs. Betty.
There was an inquisitive lift about the woman’s eyelids,
and Betty Steel, an expert in the deciphering of faces,
expected news of some sort or another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one in the drawing-room, Symons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Steel is in the study. He wished me to say that
he would see you the moment you came home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly twenty-four hours had passed since Betty Steel
had seen her husband. The physician had been called
up in the night, and had breakfasted away. She herself
had lunched with Lady Gillingham, so that their paths
had run uncrossed since yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has any one called?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may bring up tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Venetian blinds were down in the consulting room,
an initial coincidence, for Parker Steel was a believer in
light. He was sitting at the bureau by the window, but
glanced over his shoulder as his wife entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was playing with her silk scarf, and looking with
rather a puzzled air at her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve just sent off a wire to town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to Turner, for a first-class locum. The man
will be here early to-morrow. Shut the door, dear—shut
the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an irritable harshness of voice and a jerkiness
of manner that betrayed unusual lack of self-control.
Her husband’s back was half turned to her, and he was
scribbling on a sheet of paper that he had before him, but
she could see the frown upon his forehead and the nervous
working of his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing serious, only one of your prophecies
come home to roost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My prophecies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, about overwork. I was a fool not to knock off
earlier. Some inflammatory trouble in my eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eyes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She echoed the word, showing for the first time some
stirrings of alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strain, nothing more. It came on quite suddenly.
I shall have to have a month’s absolute rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned back, and put a hand up to his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty went to him, and leaned her hands upon the side
rail of his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t make much of them. See, I’m just writing
out a few hints and directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They look inflamed, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shrugged impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t bother about the eyes. See, I want you to give
these notes to Turner’s locum when he comes. The list
is complete, with a cross against the more important people.
The work’s lighter again; he can manage it alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” but she still looked troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall get away by the 10.15 to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—to Torquay. I’ve wired to a hotel. Ramsden
is doing eye-work down there, you know. He will soon
put me right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty stood with her hands resting on the back of his
chair. His assurances had not wholly satisfied her. She
had a vague feeling that he was keeping something back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He appeared busy dashing down professional hieroglyphics
on the paper before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not keeping anything from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything from you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is nothing dangerous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear girl, I ought to know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed, looked at the darkened window, and then
stooping suddenly, kissed him softly on the cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had reddened and drawn aside, with an irritable
knitting of the brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me alone, dear, for a while. I want to put the
practice in order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repulsed, she removed her hands from the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only anxious—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry; there’s no cause. You will stay here
and look after things for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I can have Madge to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, Betty—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say much about the eyes. It doesn’t do for a
professional man to get a reputation for feebleness in his
physical equipment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not say anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. You see, I’m rather busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned, looked round the room vaguely, her face
cold and empty of any marked expression. Then she
went slowly to the door, opened it, and passed out into
the hall. The house seemed peculiarly dim and lonely
as she climbed the stairs to her own room.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Mrs. Murchison; good-bye, old man;
wish you could have stayed with us. Shake hands,
sonny, now you’re off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A barrow-load of belated luggage went clattering by as
the shrill pipe of the guard’s whistle sounded the departure.
On the opposite platform a couple of porters
were banging empty milk-cans on to a truck. Yet from
the noise and turmoil of it all, John Tugler’s red face
shone out with a redeeming exuberance of good-will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was leaning from the window, and the two
men shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. You have been very good to us. We shall
not forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bosh, man, bosh!” and John Tugler gave Catherine
a final flourish of his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train was on the move, but Murchison still leaned
from the window, to the exclusion of his excited and irrepressible
son. We grow fond of people who have
stood by us in trouble, and John Tugler, bumptious and
money-making mortal that he was, carried many generous
impulses under his gorgeous waistcoat. The gift of
sympathy covers a multitude of imperfections, for the
heart craves bread and wine from others, and not the
philosopher’s stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Interminable barriers of brick, back yards, sour, rubbish-ridden
gardens were gliding by. Factories with
their tall chimneys, the minarets of labor, stood out above
the crowded grayness of the monotonous streets. Hardly
a tree, and not an acre of green grass, in Wilton. It
was as though nature had cursed the place, and left it
no symbol of the season, no passing pageantry of summer,
autumn, or of spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had kept Jack by her side, and the boy was
kneeling on the seat and looking out of the window.
She felt that her husband was in no mood for the child’s
chattering. In leaving Wilton he was leaving a poignant
part of reality behind, to enter upon a life that should
try the strength of his manhood as a bowman tries a
bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old lady and a consumptive clerk were their only
fellow-travellers. Murchison had chosen a corner whose
window looked towards the west, and an intense and determined
face it was that stared out over the ugliness of
Wilton town. Houses had given place to market-gardens,
acres of cabbages, flat, dismal, and dotted with zinc-roofed
sheds. Beyond came the slow, sad heave of the
Wilton hills, and, seen dimly—white specks upon the
hill-side—the crowded head-stones where the dead slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of husband and wife met for a moment. They
smiled at each other with the wistful cheerfulness of two
people who have determined to be brave, a pathetic pretence
hardly created to deceive. Moroseness need not
testify deep feeling. The gleam from between the clouds
turns even the wet clouds to gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Murchison was watching a couple of colts cantering
across a field beside the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, look at the old horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly old things. They’re making that old cow run.
The brown one’s like Wellington, the horse we had before
dad bought the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P’r’aps it is Wellington?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, Wellington must be dead by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady in the opposing corner was looking at
Jack over her spectacles, and the boy took to returning
the stare with the inimitable composure of youth. Catherine
had turned again towards the other window, but the
white head-stones no longer checkered the hill-side. Instead,
she saw her husband’s profile, stern and determined,
yet infinitely sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life has been described as a series of sensations; and
though some days are dull and passionless, others vibrate
with a thousand waves of feeling. To Murchison the day
had been crowded with sensation since the break of dawn.
It was a day of disruption, a plucking up of routine from
the soil, a change of attitude that concerned the soul even
more than the body. He yearned towards Wilton, and
yet fled from it with gratitude; his old home called to him,
and yet he dreaded it as a disgraced man might fear the
shocked faces of familiar friends. It was a day of unrest,
self-judgment, and great forethought for him. The
physical atoms seemed to tremble and vibrate, till the
manhood in him might have been likened to a tremulous
vapor. He could eat nothing, fix his mind on nothing.
Even the sagging wires, coming and going as the train
swept from pole to pole, were not unsymbolical of his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hundred miles, with an hour’s wait in London,
and the monotonous Midlands gave place to the more
mysterious and dreamy south. Pine-crowned hills, great
oaks and beeches purpling the villages, the blue distance
of a more magical horizon. In orchards and meadows
the infinite glamour of a golden spring. Quiet rivers curling
through the mists of green. In many a park the
stately spruce built sombre, windless thickets; larches
glimmered with Scotch firs red-throated towards the west.
Trees in whispering and triumphant multitudes. Quiet,
dreamy meadows where the willows waved. Mysterious
Isles of Avalon imaginable towards the setting sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison, leaning back in his corner, watched for the
pine woods about Roxton town with a deep commingling
of yearning and of dread. It was to be a home-coming,
and yet what a home-coming! The return of a prodigal,
but no cringing prodigal; the return of a man, stiff-necked
and square-jawed, ready to fight but not to conciliate.
There was something of the tense expectancy of the hour
before the bugles blow the assault. Every nerve in Murchison’s
body tingled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy Jack was jumping from foot to foot at the
other window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, mother, look, there’s old Mr. Tomkin’s farm!
And there’s the river. Look—and the kingcups are out!
Gwen used to call ’em—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped suddenly, for his mother had drawn him
to her and smothered the words with her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take care of the rugs and umbrellas, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Shall I get ’em down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a minute. Sit still, dear, and don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked across quickly at her husband. Their eyes
met. He was pale, but he smiled at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are, at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both felt that the ordeal had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They let the boy lean out of the open window as the
train ran in and slowed up beside the platform. Porteus
Carmagee and his sister were waiting by the door of the
booking-office. Jack sighted them and waved a salute,
their coach running far beyond the office, for they were
in the forepart of the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was the first out of the carriage. He lifted
the boy down, and stood waiting to help his wife with
some of her parcels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luggage, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned, and stared straight into the face of
one of his old patients. The man looked at him blankly
for a moment before recognition dawned upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, doctor. Didn’t know you, sir, at first,”
and he touched his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison’s upper lip was stiff. He looked like one
who had come to judge rather than to be judged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get my luggage out, Johnson. Three trunks, a
Gladstone, hat-box, and two wooden cases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was polite, though ready to be inquisitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you again in Roxton, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cab, sir? There’s Timmins’s fly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned abruptly from the porter to find Miss
Carmagee and Catherine kissing, and Jack tugging at his
godfather’s hands. It was Porteus in a new Panama
hat, whose whiteness made his face look brown as an
Asiatic’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my dear Murchison, ten minutes late; beast of a
line this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was good of you to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh, what?—not a bit of it. Where’s your luggage? I
abhor stations; can’t talk in comfort. This imp of darkness
can come along with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unprejudiced observer would have imagined the
little man in the most peppery of tempers. He tweaked
Jack by the ear, frowned hard at Catherine, and bit his
mustache as though possessed by some uncontrollable
spirit of impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister was straightening her bonnet-strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can drive straight home, dear; everything is
ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know how much I feel all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, you must be tired. We are going to take the
boy to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carmagee’s stout figure seemed to stand like a
breakwater between Catherine and the world, and there
was an all-sufficing courage on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People were staring; Murchison became aware of it as
they moved towards the booking-office. Several familiar
faces seemed to start up vividly out of the past. He
noticed two porters grinning and talking together beside
a pile of luggage near the bridge, and his sensitive pride
concluded that they were making him their mark. The
ticket collector was a thin, gray-headed man whom Murchison
had known for years. He found himself conjecturing,
as one conjectures over trifles at such a pass,
whether the man would remember him or not. The
official received the tickets without vouchsafing a glimmer
of recognition. But he stared after Murchison when he
had passed, with that curious, peering insolence typical of
the breed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the station a very throaty individual in a very
big cap, Harris tweed suit, white stock, and mulberry
red waistcoat, was giving instructions to a porter with
regard to a barrow-load of luggage. A trim dog-cart
stood by the curb, with a sleek little woman in a tailor-made
costume perched on the seat, and looking down
on everybody with something of the keenness of a
hawk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It so happened that this exquisite piece of “breeding,”
this Colonel Larter of county fame, stepped back against
Murchison in turning towards his dog-cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were reinforced by a surprised and rather
impertinent stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t trouble to mention it, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you do? Had heard you were knocking about
down our way. Wife well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Larter’s glance had passed the figure in black,
and had fixed itself on the Carmagees and Catherine.
There is always some charm about a handsome woman
that can command courtesy, and Colonel Larter walked
round Murchison with the <span class='it'>sang-froid</span> of a superior person,
and ignored the husband in appearing impressive to the
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you do, Mrs. Murchison? Back in Roxton?
Miss Carmagee has been keeping secrets from us. Quite
a crime, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had seen the slighting of her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are back again, Colonel Larter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good. To stay?” and he nodded affably to the
lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the piccaninnies? Hallo, here’s one of them!
And where’s my little flirt? What! Left her behind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Larter had one of those high-pitched, patronizing
voices that carry a goodly distance and allow casual
listeners to benefit by their remarks. Yet even his obtuse
conceit was struck by Catherine Murchison’s manner.
A sudden sense of distance and discomfort obtruded
itself upon the gentleman’s consciousness. He caught
Porteus Carmagee’s brown, birdlike eye, and the glint
thereof was curiously disconcerting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect you’re busy. My wife’s waiting for me;
mustn’t delay,” and he withdrew with a jerk of his peaked
cap, repassing Murchison with an oblivious serenity, and
rejoining his wife, who had acknowledged the presence of
acquaintances by a single inclination of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Insufferable ass! Where’s that luggage? Ah, here
we are,” and Porteus opened the cab-door with emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in, Kate, you’ll find everything shipshape at
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come across later?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we shall expect you both. We have not thanked
you yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if I’m to be thanked, I sha’n’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that,” and Murchison’s hand rested for a
moment on Porteus Carmagee’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lombard Street again, broad, tranquil Lombard Street,
warm with its red-walled houses, shaded by its cypresses,
its budding elms and limes, St. Antonia’s steeple clear
against the blue. The old house itself, white-sashed
and sun-steeped, curtains at the windows, the steps white
and fresh as snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A head disappeared from the hall window as the cab
drove up; the front door opened; they were welcomed by
a homely and familiar face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is like home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad, ma’am, I’m glad—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine kissed her. They were both good women,
and heart met heart in that home-coming, so full of
memories of mingled joy and pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good to see you here, Mary,” and Murchison
held out a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sir, it was good to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will only have one to worry you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t a worry, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she retreated because her weakness was a woman’s
weakness and showed itself in tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man was helping the cabman with the luggage. He
came in carrying one end of a heavy trunk, cap in hand,
gaiters on legs, a smart figure that seemed a little faded
and out of fortune, to judge by the threadbare cleanliness
of its clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, you here, Gage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man colored up like a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you, sir, and you, ma’am. The old house
begins to look itself again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, Gage. Old faces make a welcome
surer. We shall want you if you are free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only too happy, sir. Family man now, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, married!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A year last Easter, sir,” and he disappeared up the
stairs, carrying the lower end of the trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour had passed. Husband and wife had wandered
over the whole house together, and found many an old
familiar friend that had been saved from the wreck of
that disastrous year. The sympathetic touch showed
everywhere, a reverent and sensitive spirit had schemed
and plotted to retain the past. The coloring of each room
was the same as of old; much of the furniture had been
rebought; the very pictures were as so many memories.
It was home, and yet not the home they had known of
yore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it feel strange to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is all so real, and yet there is something we
shall always miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were standing together at the study window, looking
out into the garden that was lit with flowers. Polyanthuses
were as so many gems scattered on the brown
earth of the beds. An almond-tree was still in bloom, a
blush of pink against the sky. Tulips, red, white, and
yellow, lifted their cups to the falling dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can never be the same, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, our little one. And yet—in death—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child has given me victory over myself. As I
trust God, dear, I believe that curse is dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house is cleansed; we have come home together.
I am ready now to face my fellow-men.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that a pretty woman is never out of patience
when she has a glass to gaze at, and Betty Steel, casting
critical yet complacent glances into the depths of a
Venetian mirror, awaited the descent of her very particular
friend, Madge Ellison, with the sweet content of a
lily waiting for the moon. Mrs. Betty’s face was a Diana’s
face, but her body was of the color of a blush-rose in her
summer-rose dress. The figure had charm enough as it
idled to and fro in the spacious, mellow-tinted room.
Mirror and window showed her patronage; the one, symbolical
of self alone; the other of that same self’s outlook
upon life at large. Betty was in one of her most radiant
moods. A letter had come for her from her husband by
the morning post; his eyes were much better, and there
was no cloud upon the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel’s wife heard the frou-frou of a silk petticoat
sweeping down the stairs, the sudden opening of the
study door, a man’s footstep crossing the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, out to tea again in your best frock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rustling of silk ceased for a moment at the foot of
the stairs. Betty Steel smiled like a wise and intelligent
elder sister. Madge Ellison, and their most stylish <span class='it'>locum-tenens</span>,
Dr. Little, had reached that degree of familiarity
that permits two people to spar amiably with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A grievance, as usual! I suppose you grudge us the
carriage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing half so selfish, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not come and pay calls with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old proverb, Miss Ellison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little goes a long way, is that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I so little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s in a name!” and she passed on with a significant
side glance and an arch lifting of the chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little, a black-chinned, tailor-waisted, superfine
person, with a distinct “air,” proceeded on a hypothetical
expedition up the stairs. He had remembered leaving
his latch-key in his bedroom, a useful excuse for meeting
a pretty woman on the way, as though the coincidence
were supremely natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Au revoir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ellison favored him with an undeniable wink as
she picked up a pink parasol from the hall table. She
was one of those women who remind one forcibly of the
stage-beauty as seen on very young men’s mantel-pieces.
Madge Ellison would show as much of an open-work
stocking as was compatible with social refinement. A
<span class='it'>retroussé</span> nose and a round and rather cheeky chin associated
themselves naturally with her methods of fascination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, quick, I want you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul, why this tragic note?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, the window; do you recognize any one by the
church-railings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a hard abruptness in Betty Steel’s voice.
She was leaning forward with her hand on the window-sill,
her face curiously changed in its expression from the
purring contentment of two minutes ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see a solitary female, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you recognize her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ellison gave a quaint and expressive little whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, surely, it can’t be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, dear, it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two friends watched the figure in black disappear
under the old gate-house that stood at the northwest corner
of the square. For Madge Ellison there was nothing
more inspiriting than curiosity in the event. To Betty
Steel that passing glimpse had opened up all the hatred
of the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s in your mind, Madge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ellison was buttoning her gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet a tea-cake to a penny bun, dear, that it is the
Murchisons who have taken their house in Lombard
Street again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s eyes grew hard and dangerous at the suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why nonsense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Murchisons would hardly have the impudence
to sneak back to Roxton. People don’t care to be bungled
into the next world by a drunkard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word, Betty, draw it mild. I never heard that
the man drank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were in Italy, then, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nasty, nasty! You are peevish over the poor people’s
failings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate that woman, Madge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ellison laughed at the sincerity of her friend’s
spite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what earthly harm can that woman do you by
choosing to live in Roxton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Madge, there are some people in this world
who set one’s teeth on edge. After all, what need for all
this waste of antipathy. Kate Murchison must be staying
with the Carmagees. I’ll risk that as my explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spirited away on a round of social duties, Betty Steel
and her friend paid their third call that afternoon at the
Canonry in Canon’s Court, off Cloister Street. A row of
carriages under the avenue of limes, and a liveried servant
standing on duty under the Georgian portico, reminded
Betty Steel that the third Friday in the month
was the date printed on Mrs. Stensly’s cards. Betty
and her gossip were announced in the crowded drawing-room,
where a number of bored figures were balancing
teacups and talking with forced animation. A few men,
severely saddened by their responsibilities, were treading
on each other’s heels, and looking anxiously for ladies
who would take pity on sandwiches or cake. The French
windows of the room were open to the May sunshine
of the garden, and the fringes of a cedar could be seen
sweeping the sleek grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Individual faces disassociate themselves slowly from
such an assemblage, and Betty Steel, blockaded under the
lee of a grand-piano, had but half the room under the ken
of her keen eyes. Madge Ellison had been left to chat
with Mr. Keightly, a very popular and enthusiastic curate
who had rendered his character doubly fascinating by
professing to hold prejudices in favor of celibacy. Betty
had a brewer’s wife at her elbow. They had exchanged
ecstatic confidences on the exquisite shape and color of
Mrs. Stensly’s tea-service, and were both groping for
some further topic to keep the conversation moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is the play going, Mrs. Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty seemed unusually pensive and distraught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Sophia’s play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As well as a piece can go—with amateurs. We all
find fault with our neighbors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear it is a splendid little play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must say I like the pathetic style of play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, quite charming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw Julia Neilson play in that play, oh—what was
the play called?—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘A Woman of no Ideal,’ most likely,” thought Mrs.
Betty. “I wonder how many more times she is going to
tread on that one unfortunate word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waited demurely for the title to recur, but it appeared
lost in the limbo of the fat lady’s mind. The
brewer’s wife continued to grope for it like a conscientious
housewife who has lost the Sabbath threepenny bit in her
glove-box while dressing for church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel, however, had become utterly oblivious of
her presence for the moment. She was gazing towards
one of the open windows where a woman’s figure, tall and
comely in simple black, showed against the rich green of
the grass. The woman’s back was turned towards the
room, but Betty knew her by her figure and the lustre of
her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very odd, Mrs. Steel, I can’t remember the name of
that play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, I beg your pardon, I was thinking of other
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight rearranging of this aggregate of Roxton culture
released Betty Steel from this amiable mass of irresponsible
bathos. She contrived to wedge herself beside
Madge Ellison, whose <span class='it'>retroussé</span> nose had failed to tempt
the celibate to expand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smart hat was tilted significantly towards the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have lost, dear. The tea-cake is on top. The
sensation of Roxton. They are here to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Betty’s face expressed infinite pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How eccentric!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate Murchison has had money left her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear his plate is up in Lombard Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was a mere matter of coincidence or the
working of a definite purpose, the fact was curiously self-evident
to Betty Steel that the drawing-room of the
Canonry had divided itself into two camps. Window-ward
sat Miss Carmagee, dressed in black, her large
face shining like a buckler against the embattled foe.
Porteus—the irascible Porteus who blasphemed all tea-parties—was
chattering like a little brown baboon. Several
of Kate Murchison’s old friends appeared to have
congregated together on the opposition benches. Mrs.
Betty remarked all this, and her mouth grew a mere line
in her pale and alert face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breweress had risen to depart. A number of
nervous people who had been waiting for some bold spirit
to initiate the movement, followed the fat lady’s inspiriting
example. Mrs. Stensly was in the garden. The
breweress and her flock of sheep filed through the open
window to shake hands—and go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, dear, am I sitting on you? Whither away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To pay my most dutiful respects!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine Murchison and the Canon had left the window,
and were pacing the grass under the benisons of the
great cedar. By the expression of their faces, and the
serious yet sympathetic inflection of their voices, they had
broken the mere social surface, and were speaking of
deeper things. It is the fashion to abuse the priesthood
in the abstract, yet any critic who took the clean-girt manliness
of Canon Stensly’s character might find his rhetoric
chilled in its free flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done the right thing, and your true friends
will be glad of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my husband’s wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wish of a brave man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a wonderful thing is sympathy! You have
helped me so much this afternoon. It was an ordeal.
You know, we dread the unknown—uncertainty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big, gray-headed man looked down at her with
much of the affection of a father. His hands had given
her confirmation and joined her hand in marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubt is a great distorting glass,” he said, simply;
“the difficulties of life decrease the moment they are
faced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you are on our side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be a poor Christian if I were not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A figure in a pink dress, sumptuous and perfect as to
the milliner’s craft, glided across the grass, and cast a
shadow at Catherine’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you do, Kate? You have surprised us all—assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women touched hands. Betty Steel’s drawl
ascended towards patronage. She assumed the air of a
mistress of a <span class='it'>salon</span> whose salutation decided destinies
and dispensed fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Dr. Murchison? This long rest must have
done him good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. My husband is very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid we all misunderstood your plans. We
thought you had left Roxton for good. I suppose Dr.
Murchison will not expose himself again to the strain of
general practice. Surgical cases are such a responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the ability of women to be politely insolent and
to cover a taunt with ironical courtesy. There were at
least a dozen people within range of Mrs. Betty’s aggressive
drawl, and Betty Steel had no intention of letting
Roxton forget James Murchison’s past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how are the children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were studying the details of Catherine’s dress
with the critical acuteness so trying to a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy is very well, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the other—a girl, was it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not trouble to remember her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds as though you were disappointed. I
remember how you used to read me texts on the divinity
of motherhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child is dead, Betty, that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to hear that. I always thought the girl was
delicate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly’s massive shadow interposed itself between
the slighter silhouettes upon the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your husband has kept his promise, Mrs. Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yonder, with my wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s face was tinged with a malignity that
leaked from her eyes and from the sneering angles of
her mouth. She felt glad that Catherine’s favorite child
was dead. The incomprehensible malice in the thought
justified itself in the reflection that Catherine had lost
something that she, Betty, had always lacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed James Murchison as she returned towards
the house, a man with a certain dignity of past suffering
writ heavily upon his face. He was talking to two old
friends. Betty swept by him without troubling to notice
whether he bowed to her or not. The man was a mere
pawn in the game so far as she was concerned. Any
humiliation that he might suffer was only valuable so
far as it humiliated his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage was waiting for them under the limes of
Canon’s Court. Madge Ellison flounced down in her
corner with a relieved sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a function! Well, how is she, charming as
ever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know whom I mean, Betty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That beast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard you call her that once when we were at school,”
and Miss Ellison tittered; “I believe she’ll make the whole
town swallow the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she—indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t relish the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, my dear girl; we have not seen the end of the
game yet.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Roxton, like a certain lady of literary fame, was
ever ready with its free opinions on any subject
that it did not understand. The return of the Murchisons
had exercised the town’s capacity for criticism, and
inaugurated a debate that was to be heard at public-house
bars, as well as in the parlors of the pious. The
facts of the case were generally agreed upon; but facts
are things that the ingenious mind of man can juggle
with. The complexion of the affair varied with the convictions
of the debater, and the sacred incidents of home
life profaned or honored according to the temper of the
tongue that dealt with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Mill Lane the case had a most energetic exponent
in the person of Mr. William Bains, the sweep. A certain
brewer’s drayman, who had won some crude celebrity
as an atheist, had taken upon himself to argue on
the adverse side. The two gentlemen squared to each
other one evening at the bottom of the lane, and thrashed
it out strenuously before a meagre but attentive crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the inquest? Didn’t we read the ’ole of
it in the <span class='it'>Mail and Times</span>? Yer can’t get away from
facts, can yer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And supposin’ he did make a mistake for once, does
that mean callin’ a man a fool and a danger to the public?
Who drove his cart last week into a pillar-box by Wilson’s
grocery shop?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bains scored a palpable hit. The audience laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got ’im there, William,” said a neighbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drayman sniffed, and threw out his stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Facts is facts. Doctorin’ ain’t drivin’ ’osses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank the Lord, Mr. Sweetyer, it ain’t, for our
sakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say the man blundered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who ’asn’t run ’is nose into a lamp-post on occasions?
Why, look ’ere,” and Mr. Bains stretched out a
didactic forefinger, “when my little girl ’ad the diphtheria,
who pulled ’er through? And who saved old Jenny
Lowther’s leg? And there was young Ben Thompson,
who some London joker swore was a dyin’ man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” said a bony woman in an old red blouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drayman, finding the neighbors inclined to take the
sweep’s view of the matter, began to look hot, and a little
nettled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what ’ave yer got to say about the booze?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon that’s more your business than mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the audience caught the gibe and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three gallons a day, that’s ’is measure,” interjected
a morose gentleman, who was hanging over his garden
gate and smoking the stump of a clay pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t ’e carried ’ome from the club?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P’r’aps ’e was, p’r’aps ’e wasn’t. Any fool could ’ave
seen that the man ’ad been workin’ hisself to death. Why,
he fainted bang off one mornin’, round at our ’ouse. Ask
my missus. A thimbleful o’ brandy would ’ave made a
man in ’is state ’ug the railin’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, he hugged ’em,” said the obdurate opponent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ain’t always responsible for what we do when we’ve
’ad a bad smack over the side of the jaw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doct’rs oughtn’t ter touch it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a nice one to preach, now, ain’t yer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is that,” quoth the laconic worthy at the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look ’ere, don’t you go shovin’ it into me—sideways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me argue ’im, Mr. Catt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Argue, you ’ain’t got a leg to stand on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I, my boy!” and the two disputants began to
glare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drayman wiped his hands on the back of his
breeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some fool’ll be callin’ me a liar soon,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s on the cards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look ’ere, Bill Bains, I’ve ’ad enough of your sarce.
Stow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go and bully your kids. Can’t I speak my mind
when I bloomin’ well like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course ’e can,” said the lady in the red blouse; “and
’e speaks it well, ’e does. Murchison was always a right
down gentleman; better than that there little nipper,
Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right for you, Mrs. Penny. We don’t go blackguardin’
other people’s characters, do we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t blackguardin’ the man, I’m statin’ facts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Facts, facts—why, the man’s clean daft on facts. Facts
must be another name for a pint of bitter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll smash your jaw, Bill Bains, if you don’t stow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smash away, my buck. Who’s afraid of a bloomin’
cask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereon the dwellers in Mill Lane were treated to an
exhibition of two minutes straight hitting, an exhibition
that ended in the intervention of friends. But since the
drayman departed with a red nose and a swollen eye, it
may be inferred that the sweep had the best of the argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To have one’s past, present, and future dragged through
the back streets of a country town is not an experience
that a man of self-respect would welcome. A sensitive
spirit cannot fail to feel the atmosphere about it. It may
see the sun shining, the clouds white against the blue,
the natural phenomena of health and of well-being; or
the faces of a man’s fellows may be as sour puddles to
him, their sympathy a wet December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trite as the saying is, that in trouble we make trial of
our friends, only those who have faced defeat know the
depth and meaning of that time-worn saying. A week
in Roxton betrayed to Catherine and her husband the
number and the sincerity of their friends. The instinct
of pride is wondrous quick in detecting truth from shams,
even as an expert’s fingers can tell old china by the feel.
The population of the place was soon mapped out into
the priggishly polite, the piously distant, the vulgarly inquisitive,
the unaffected honest, and the honestly indifferent.
Catherine met many a face that brightened to
hers in the Roxton streets. The past seemed to have
banked more good-will for them then they had imagined.
It was among the poor that they found the least forgetfulness,
less of the cultured and polite hauteur, less affectation,
less hypocrisy. As for the practice, they found
it non-existent that first humiliating yet half-happy week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps the sincerest person in Roxton at that
moment was the wife of Dr. Parker Steel. Betty was not
a passionate woman in the matter of her affections, but in
her capabilities for hatred she concentrated the energy
of ten. She had come quite naturally to regard herself
as the most gifted and interesting feminine personality
that Roxton could boast. Every woman has an instinctive
conviction that her own home, and her own children,
are immeasurably superior to all others. With Betty
Steel, this spirit of womanly egotism had been largely
centred on herself. She had no children to make her
jealous and critical towards other women’s children. It
was the symmetry of her own success in life that had
developed into an enthralling art, an art that absorbed
her whole soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might have been imagined that she had climbed too
high to trouble about an old hate; that she was too sufficiently
assured of her own glory to stoop to attack a
humbled rival. Jealousy and a sneaking suspicion of
inferiority had embittered the feud for her of old; and
Kate Murchison, saddened and aged, half a suppliant
for the loyalty of a few good friends, could still inspire in
Betty a spirit of aggressive and impatient hate. She remembered
that she had seen Catherine triumphant where
she herself had received indifference and disregard. The
instinct to crush this antipathetic rival was as fierce and
keen in her as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call on her,” had been Madge Ellison’s suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call on her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be more diplomatic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you imagine, Madge, that I am going to make
advances to that woman? She used to snub me once;
my turn has come. I give the Murchisons just six months
in Roxton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How little mercy Betty Steel had in that intolerant and
subtle heart of hers was betrayed by the strategic move
that opened the renewal of hostilities. She had driven
Kate Murchison out of Roxton once, and the arrogance
of conquest was as fierce in this slim, refined-faced woman
as in any Alexander. She moved in a small and limited
sphere, but the aggressive spirit was none the less inevitable
in its lust to overthrow. The motives were the
meaner for their comparative minuteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Sophia’s Bazaar Committee met in Roxton public
hall one day towards the end of May, to consider the
arrangement of stalls, and to settle a number of decorative
details. Betty had spent half the morning at her
escritoire sorting letters, meditating chin on hand, scribbling
on the backs of old envelopes, which she afterwards
took care to burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed in her happiest vein that afternoon, as she
left Madge Ellison to provide tea for Dr. Little, and
drove to the public hall with her despatch-box full of the
Bazaar Fund’s correspondence. No one would have
imagined it possible for such refinement and charm to
cover instincts that were not unallied to the instincts found
in an Indian jungle. Mrs. Betty went through her business
with briskness and precision; the committee left their
chairs to discuss the grouping of the stalls about the
room. There were to be twelve of these booths, each to
represent a familiar flower; Lady Sophia had elected herself
a rose. Mrs. Betty’s choice had been Oriental
poppies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Sophia was parading the hall with a pair of pince-nez
perched on the bridge of her nose, and a memorandum-book
open in her hand. A group of deferential ladies followed
her like hens about the farmer’s wife at feeding-time.
The most trivial suggestion that fell from those
aristocratic lips was seized upon and swallowed with
relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, dear, have you heard from Jennings about the
draperies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glory of it, to be “my deared” in public by Lady
Sophia Gillingham!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have a letter somewhere, and a list of prices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might pin up the letter and the price-list on the
black-board by the door, so that the stall-holders can take
advantage of any item that may be of use to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty moved to the table and rummaged amid her
multifarious correspondence. She was chatting all the
while to a Miss Cozens, a thin, wiry little woman, alert
as a Scotch-terrier in following up the scent of favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lot of work the bazaar has given you, Mrs.
Steel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, quite enough,” and she divided her attention
between Miss Cozens and the pile of papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When is the next rehearsal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tuesday, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear you are the genius of the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?” and Betty smiled like an ingenuous girl. “I
am most horribly nervous. I always feel that I am spoiling
the part. Oh, here’s Jennings’s letter, and the list, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left the two papers lying unheeded for the moment,
while she answered Miss Cozens’s interested questions on
costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Primrose and leaf green, that will be lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so everybody says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Sophia’s voice interrupted the gossip. She was
beckoning to Betty with her memorandum-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, can you spare me a moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Cozens’s sharp eyes gave an envious twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I pin up the papers for you, Mrs. Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Betty swept two sheets of paper towards Miss
Cozens without troubling to glance at them, and turned
to wait on Lady Sophia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several ladies congregated about the black-board as
Miss Cozens pinned up the letter and the price-list with
such conscientious promptitude that she had not troubled
to read their contents. Had she had eyes for the faces
of her neighbors she might have been struck by the
puzzled eagerness of their expression. One elderly committee
woman readjusted her glasses, and then touched
Miss Cozens with a pencil that she carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is some mistake—I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mistake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that letter”—and the spectacled lady pointed to
the black-board with her pencil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Cozens took the trouble to investigate the charge.
The letter was written on one broad sheet in a neat, bold
hand. Miss Cozens’s prim little mouth pursed itself up
expressively as she read; her brows contracted, her
eyes stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heavens!—what’s this? I must have taken the
wrong letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tore the sheet down, pushed past her neighbors,
and crossed the room towards Betty Steel. The group
about the black-board appeared to be discussing the incident.
Mr. Jennings’s list of silks and drapings seemed
forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Steel, excuse me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This letter; there’s some mistake. It’s the wrong one.
I pinned it up, and Mrs. Saker called my attention to the
error.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Cozens gave her the sheet, intense curiosity quivering
in every line of her doglike face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heavens!—how did this get mixed up with my
business correspondence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked perturbation to perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Cozens, what am I to do? Has any one read
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little woman nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How horrible! I must explain—It must not go any
further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty hurried across the hall towards the door, hesitated,
and looked round her as though baffled by indecision.
She knew well enough that inquisitive eyes
were watching her. Her skill as an actress—and she was
consummately clever as a hypocrite—served to heighten
the meaning that she wished to convey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Sophia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty had doubled adroitly in the direction of the
amiable aristocrat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I speak to you alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have done such an awful thing. Do help me.
You have so much nerve and tact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child, steady yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked out Jennings’s papers; Miss Cozens was chattering
to me, and when you called me, she offered to pin
the things on the board. How on earth it happened, I
cannot imagine, but a private letter of mine had got
mixed up with the bazaar correspondence. It must have
been lying by Jennings’s list, for Miss Cozens, without
troubling to read it, pinned it on the board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The perturbed, sensitive creature was breathless and
all a-flutter. Lady Sophia patted her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear, I see no great harm yet—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! It was a letter from an old friend abroad, a
letter that contained certain confessions about a Roxton
family. What on earth am I to do? Look, here it is,
read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Sophia read the letter, holding it at arm’s-length
like the music of a song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heavens, Betty, I never knew the man drank,
that it had been a habit—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Lady Sophia, don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have been more careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know—I know. I shall never forgive myself. For
goodness’ sake, help me. You have so much more tact
than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her ladyship accepted the responsibility with stately
unction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to me, dear. I can go round and have a quiet
talk with all those who happened to read the letter. How
unfortunate that the opening sentences should have contained
this information. Still, it need never get abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How good of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, dear, you are rather upset, most naturally
so—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I had better retreat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, leave it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, oh, so much. Tell them not to whisper
a word of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no difficulty, dear, about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty, white and troubled, added a sharper flavor to
the stew by withdrawing dramatically from the stage.
And any one wise as to the contradictoriness of human
nature could have prophesied how the news would spread
had he seen the Lady Sophia voyaging on her diplomatic
mission round the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mrs. Steel! Such an unfortunate coincidence!
Not a woman easily upset, but, believe me, my dear Mrs.
So-and-So, it was as much a shock to her as though she
had heard bad news of her husband. Now, I am quite
sure this unpleasant affair will go no further. Of course
not. I rely absolutely on your discretion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And since the discretion of a provincial town is complex
to a degree of an ever-repeated confession, coupled
with a solemn warning against repetition, it was not improbable
that this froth would haunt the pot for many a
long day.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>June is the month for the old world garden that holds
mystery and fragrance within its red-brick walls.
In Lombard Street you would suspect no wealth of flowers,
and yet in the passing through of one of those solid, mellow,
Georgian houses you might meet dreams from the
bourn of a charmed sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aloofness is the note of such a garden. It is no piece
of pompous mosaic-work spread before the front windows
of a stock-broker’s villa, a conventional color scheme
to impress the public. The true garden has no studied
ostentation. It is a charm apart, a quiet corner of life
smelling of lavender, built for old books, and memories
that have the mystery of hills touched by the dawn. You
will find the monk’s-hood growing in tall campaniles ringing
a note of blue; columbines, fountains of gold and red;
great tumbling rose-trees like the foam of the sea; stocks
all a-bloom; pansies like antique enamel-work; clove-pinks
breathing up incense to meet the wind-blown fragrance
of elder-trees in flower. You may hear birds singing as
though in the wild deeps of a haunted wood whose trees
part the sunset into panels of living fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary of the plain face and the loyal heart had opened
the green front door to a big man, whose broad shoulders
seemed fit to bear the troubles of the whole town. He
had asked for Catherine and her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are in the garden, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, only Master Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly bowed his iron-gray head under the
Oriental curtain that screened the passage leading from
the hall to the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks; I know the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rector of St. Antonia’s came out into the sunlight,
and stood looking about him for an instant with the air
of a man whose eyes were always open to what was admirable
in life. A thrush had perched itself on the pinnacle
of a yew, and was singing his vesper-song with the
broad west for an altar of splendid gold. The chiming
of the hour rang from St. Antonia’s steeple half hid by
the green mist of its elms. A few trails of smoke rising
from red-brick chimney-stacks alone betrayed the presence
of a town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To an old college-man such an evening brought back
memories of sunny courts, cloisters, and sleek lawns, the
ringing of bells towards sunset, the dark swirl of a river
under the yawn of bridges that linked gardens to gardens
beneath the benisons of mighty trees. Yet the light on
Canon Stensly’s face was not wholly a placid light. It
was as though he came as a messenger from the restless,
bickering outer world, a friend whom friendship freighted
with words not easy to be said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glimmer of white under an old cherry-tree showed
where Catherine sat reading, with the boy Jack prone on
the grass, the <span class='it'>Swiss Family Robinson</span> under his chin.
Murchison was lying back in a deck-chair, watching the
smoke from his pipe amid the foliage overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Jack, rolling from elbow to elbow, as he thrilled
over the passage of the “tub-boat” from the wreck,
caught sight of the Canon crossing the lawn. Catherine
was warned by a tug at her skirts, and a very audible
stage-aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out, here’s old Canon Stensly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S-sh, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should like to see him afloat in a tub-boat. Take
a big—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tweak of the ear nipped the boy’s reflection in the
bud. His father gave him a significant push in the direction
of the fruit garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See if there are any strawberries ripe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve looked twice, dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no doubt. Go and look again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly’s big fist had closed on Catherine’s
fingers. He was not the conventional figure, the portly,
smiling cleric, the man of the world with a benignant yet
self-sufficient air. Like many big men, silent and peculiarly
sensitive, his quiet manner suggested a diffidence
anomalous in a man of six feet two. To correct the impression
one had but to look at the steady blue of the eye,
the firm yet sympathetic mouth, the stanchness of the
chin. It is a fallacy that lives perennially, the belief that
a confident face, an aggressive manner, and much facility
of speech necessarily mark the man of power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A courtly person would have remarked on the beauty
of the evening, and discovered something in the garden
to praise. Canon Stensly was not a man given to pleasant
commonplaces. He said nothing, and sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison handed him his cigar-case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, not before dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His habit of silence, the silence of a man who spoke
only when he had something definite to say, gave him, to
strangers, an expression of reserve. Canon Stensly invariably
made talkative men feel uncomfortable. It was
otherwise with people who had learned to know the nature
of his sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, what literature have we here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up Jack’s discarded book, and turned over
the pages as though the illustrations brought back recollections
of his own youth. As a boy he had been the most
irrepressible young mischief-monger, a youngster whom
Elisha would have bequeathed to the bear’s claws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever a member of the Robinson family, Mrs. Murchison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine caught a suspicious side glint in his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose all children read the book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how much of the moralizing you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor do I. Children demand life—not moralizing
upon life,” and the Canon scrutinized a picture portraying
the harpooning of a turtle, as though he had gloated
over that picture many times as a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine had caught a glimpse of Mary’s white apron
signalling for help in some domestic problem. She was
glad of the excuse to leave the two men together. The
sense of a woman is never more in evidence than when
she surrenders her husband to a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you spare me half an hour for a talk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not overburdened with work—yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it will come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned over the pages deliberately, glancing at each
picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wife looks well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in spite of everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of heart and pluck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has the courage of a Cordelia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly put the book down upon the grass.
The two men were silent awhile; Murchison lying back
in his chair, smoking; the churchman leaning forward a
little with arms folded, his massive face set rather sternly
in the repose of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is something I want to talk to you about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned his head, but did not move his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t set me down as a busybody. I think I have a
duty to you as a friend. It is a matter of justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canon’s virtues were of the practical, workman-like
order. He was not an eloquent man in the oratorical
sense, having far too straightforward and sincere a personality
to wax hysterical for the benefit of a church full
of women. But he was a man who was listened to by
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison turned half-restlessly in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With reference to the old scandal?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something unpleasant, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things that are put about behind one’s back are
generally unpleasant. It was my wife who discovered
the report. Women hear more lies than we do, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a rule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I decided that it was only fair that you should know,
since slandered people are generally the last to hear of
their own invented sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I appreciate honesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly sat motionless a moment, staring at the
house. Then he rose up leisurely from his chair, reached
for one of the branches of the cherry-tree, drew it down
and examined the forming fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say that you used to drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison remained like an Egyptian Memnon looking
towards Thebes. The churchman talked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard the same thing said about one or two
of my dearest friends. Vile exaggerations of some explainable
incident. The report originated from a certain lady
who resides over against my church. Her husband is a
professional man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled down a second bough, and brushed the young
fruit with his fingers to see whether it was set or not.
The silence had something of the tension of expense.
Murchison knew that this old friend was waiting for a
denial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s quite true; I drank—at one time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man of less ballast and less unselfishness would have
rounded on the speaker, perhaps with an affected incredulity
that would have embittered the consciousness
of the confession. Canon Stensly did nothing so insignificant.
He let the branch of the cherry-tree slip slowly
through his fingers, put his hands in his pockets, and
walked aside three paces as though to examine the tree
at another angle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause of a few seconds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father drank; poor old dad! I’m not trying to
shelve the affair by putting it on his shoulders. My
father and my grandfather both died of drink. My wife
knows. She did not know when we were married. That
was wrong. If ever a man owed anything to the love of
a good woman, I am that man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly returned to his chair. His face bore
the impress of deep thought. He had the air of a man
ready to help in the bearing of a brother’s burden, not
with any bombast and display, but as though it were as
natural an action as holding out a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t have been very serious,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison set his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sort of hell while it lasted, a tempting of the devil;
not often; perhaps the worse for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I can understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was when I was overworked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jaded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wife was something better than a ministering
angel, she was a brave woman. She fought for me. We
should have won—without that scandal, but for a mad
piece of folly I took to be heroism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The churchman extended a large hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll smoke after all,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison opened his cigar-case. Canon Stensly
was as deliberate as a man wholly at his ease. There
was not a tremor as he held the lighted match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, Murchison, I appreciate this—deeply?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned the match-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It puts you in a new light to me, a finer light, with
that rare wife of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was refilling his pipe, lines of thought crossing
his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When my child died—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seemed to lose part of myself. I had crushed the
curse then. I don’t know how to explain the psychology
of the affair, but when she died, the other thing died
also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was what we call dipsomania. I never touched
alcohol for years. I had been a fool as a student. At my
worst, I only had the crave now and again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are sure—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure that that curse killed my child, indirectly. Is it
strange that her death should have killed the curse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I trust in God, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thrush was singing again on the yew-tree, another
thrush answering it from a distant garden. Canon Stensly
lay back in his chair and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay here,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Roxton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You have friends. Trust them. There is a
greater sense of justice in this world than most cynics
allow. I never knew man fight a good fight, a clean up-hill
fight, and lose in the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were smoking peacefully under the cherry-tree
when Catherine returned. She had no suspicion of what
had passed, for no storm spirit had left its torn clouds in
the summer air. Her husband’s face was peculiarly
calm and placid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s that boy of yours, Mrs. Murchison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was hunting the strawberry-beds half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him,” and the Canon chuckled, “tell him I am
not too big yet—for a tub.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Canon Stensly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. Murchison, I said many a truer thing
when I was a boy. Children strike home. To have his
vanity chastened, let a man listen to children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man with the massive head and the broad
British chest had gone. Husband and wife were sitting
alone under the cherry-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told him—all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was Betty? That woman! May she never
have to bear what we have borne!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was sitting with his elbows on his knees, his
chin upon his fists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—they know the worst—at last,” he said, grimly.
“We can clear for action. That’s a grand man, Kate.
I shall stay and fight—fight as he would were he in my
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out a hand and let it rest upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are what I would have you be, brave. Our chance
will come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God grant it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall show these people what manner of man
you are.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little descended the stairs of Major Murray’s
house with the alert and rather furtive look of a man
who has been for days subjected to the semi-sceptical
questions of interested relatives. Parker Steel had attended
at the introduction of a third Miss Murray into
the world; the whole affair had seemed but the ordinary
yearly incident in the great, rambling, florid-faced house,
whose windows appeared to have copied its owner’s
military stare. It was during Dr. Little’s regency that
Major Murray’s wife had developed certain sinister
symptoms that had worried the locum-tenens very seriously.
Concern for his own self-conceit rather than concern
for the patient, characterized Dr. Little’s attitude
towards the case. The professional spirit when cultivated
to the uttermost end of complexity, becomes an impersonation
of the intellectual ego.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thin, acute-faced woman with sandy hair appeared
at the dining-room door as Dr. Little reached the hall.
This lady with the sandy hair and freckles happened to
be the most inquisitive, suspicious, and unrebuffable of
sisters that Dr. Little had ever encountered on guard
over her brother’s domestic happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn the woman—Ah, good-morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Murray’s attitude betrayed the inevitable catechisation.
Dr. Little followed her into the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how do you find my sister-in-law this morning.
Dr. Little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Murray had an aggressive, expeditious manner
that disorganized any ordinary mortal’s sense of self-sufficiency
and vain repose. In action her hair seemed
to become sandier in color, her freckles more yellow and
independent. In speech she reminded the <span class='it'>locum-tenens</span>
of a quick-firing gun whose exasperating detonations
numbered so many snaps a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Murray is no worse this morning. In fact—I
can—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The temperature?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The temperature is a little above normal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little’s “distinguished air” became ten times more
distinguished. He articulated in his throat, and began
to pull on his gloves with gestures of great finality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you notice that reddish rash?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is our duty, Miss Murray, to notice such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the throat? It seems very red and angry—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A certain degree of pharyngitis is present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and what’s the meaning of it all, Dr. Little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning, Miss Murray? Really—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a cause for everything, I imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. The problem—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You admit then that there is something problematic
in the case, Dr. Little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a problem in every—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. But in my sister-in-law’s case, that is
the matter under discussion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, madam, it is impossible to discuss certain—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother desires something definite. He was
obliged to go to town to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should prefer to give my opinion—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Major Murray left instructions that I should wire to
his club—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His club?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether any definite conclusion had been arrived at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two disputants had been volleying and counter-volleying
at point-blank range. Neither displayed any
sign of giving ground or of surrender. The Scotch lady’s
voice had harshened into a slight rasp of natural Gaelic.
Dr. Little still fumbled at the buttons of his gloves, his
words very much in his throat, his whole pose characteristic
of the profession upon its dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite impossible, Miss Murray, for me to discuss
this case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thin lady’s pupils were no bigger than pin-heads,
so that her eyes looked like two circles of hard, blue glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Dr. Little. I must telegraph to my brother
that no conclusion has been reached—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, that would be indiscreet—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To provide—me—with a solution!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distinguished gentleman had completed the buttoning
of his gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall hope to see Major Murray in person to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall see him, Dr. Little, without fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>locum-tenens</span> conducted a dignified retreat, fully
aware of the fact that the sandy-haired lady believed him
to be an ignoramus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound the woman! How can I tell her what I
think?” he reflected. “It seems to me that there is half
a ton of domestic dynamite waiting to be exploded in that
house. I hardly relish the responsibility. If matters
don’t clear in a day or two, I shall wire for Steel. It is
his case, not mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a much-hustled man, whose temper had been chastened
by a series of irritating incidents, the picture of a
pretty woman smiling up at him from a neat luncheon-table
revivified the more sensuous satisfactions of existence.
Men who live to eat, smoke, and enjoy the curves
of a woman’s figure are in the main very docile mortals.
The savor of a well-cooked entrée will dispel despair
and bring down heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little sat down with a grieved sigh, unfolded his
napkin, and accepted Miss Ellison’s sympathy as though
it were his just and sovereign due. He still had a vision
of freckles and sandy hair, and echoes of an aggressive
voice that revived memories of the dame school he had
attended when in frocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a morning you must have had! It is nearly
two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A delightful morning, I can assure you. Excuse
me, Miss Ellison, the cover of that magazine you have
been reading reminds me of a certain female’s hair.
Would you mind removing it from sight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the memory so poignant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poignant! And she has freckles the size of pease.
Ugh! I wonder why it is that one’s patients always seem
to conspire against one by being mulish and irritating all
on the same day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something in the air, perhaps. Poor man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor man, it is, I assure you, when you have had a
series of cantankerous old ladies to blarney. I wonder
if I might have a glass of sherry? Oh, don’t bother, let
me get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though the mere offer absolved him from all further
effort, Dr. Little sat still and fed while Madge Ellison
rummaged in the sideboard for the decanter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much, a tumblerful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him as she poured out the wine, the gold
chain she wore dangling against his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. Three fingers. How angelic a thing is
woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even when she has freckles and straw-colored hair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forbear, forbear. Ah, now I began to revive a
little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drank the wine, wiped his mustache, and leaned
back in his chair as though to reflect on the natural
philosophy of life. Madge Ellison entered into the system
as a pleasing and satisfactory protoplasmic development.
To this bachelor, who already showed a tendency
to plumpness below the heart, she was bracketed with
good wine, nine-penny cigars, and well-cooked dishes, a
thing pleasant to look at and pleasant perhaps to taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Mrs. Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cutlets and new pease were pushed aside. Dr. Little
helped himself generously to sponge custard, his eyes
fixed affectionately upon the dish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am rather worried about Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worried?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bachelor began to look sleek and happy. His
outlook upon life changed greatly after a few magical
passes with a spoon and fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would go up and see her after lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything to oblige a lady who can show no freckles.
What is the woe? A cold in the head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison had returned to her chair, and was rocking
it gracefully to and fro on two legs. She might have
posed as a living metronome marking the rhythm for the
epicure’s busy spoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How frivolous you doctors are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little wiped a streak of custard from his mustache
with his dinner napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my hour of relaxation. Haven’t you heard the
tale of the two bishops who played leap-frog at the end
of a church conference. But, to be serious, what are the
symptoms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She seems rather feverish and has a sore throat. I
noticed something that looked like herpes on her lip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herpes, eh? Will she let me see her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll run up and ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. Is the paper reposing anywhere? Oh,
don’t bother. On the window-sill? Thanks, much
obliged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he propped the paper against the decanter, and so
consoled himself with the happy facility of a bachelor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel, in a richly laced dressing-jacket, was sitting
up in bed with Persian Mignon in her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring the man up, dear, if it will give you any satisfaction.
Any news in the town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison sat down and chatted for five minutes,
while the cat purred under Betty’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw Kate Murchison in Castle Gate this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; being convoyed by the Canoness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s mouth curved into a sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most respectable connection. Did you see any
blue ribbon about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are rather hard on the poor wretches, Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?” and she gave a short, sharp laugh; “every
woman sides with her husband—I suppose. You might
rub some scent on my forehead, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little finished a cigar, and yawned in turn over
every page of the paper before ascending to Mrs. Betty’s
room. Madge Ellison opened the door to him. His
shoulder brushed her arm as he entered, quite the professional
Agag where the patient was a woman and under
fifty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Little remained some fifteen minutes beside Mrs.
Betty’s bed. His air of lazy refinement left him by
degrees, giving place to the interested and puzzled alertness
of the physician. It was the curious nodular swelling
on Parker Steel’s wife’s lip that led him to discover
glandular enlargement under her round, white chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hair falling out at all?” he asked, casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why refer to a woman’s one eternal woe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing,” and he smiled a little stiffly; “the
throat is sore, is it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me look. Turn to the light, please. Open the
mouth wide, and say ‘ah.’ Hum, yes, rather inflamed,”
and Dr. Little, after moving his head from side to side,
like a man peering down the bowl of a pipe, drew back
from the bed, his eyes fixed momentarily on Betty Steel’s
face with a peculiarly intent stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send you up a gargle for the throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I shall be all right for Saturday, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the last rehearsal. I must not miss it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard from Dr. Steel to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty was holding Mignon’s head between her two
hands, and looking into the cat’s yellow eyes. Something
in the intonation of Dr. Little’s voice seemed to startle
her. She glanced up at him with a questioning smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect him back in a week or so. Madge, get me
that letter, dear. I think he said next Wednesday. Is
there anything—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little had moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wanted to know the date. I promised some
months ago to do locum work for an old friend next
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty had glanced through her husband’s letter. She
laid it aside when Dr. Little had gone, and took Mignon
back into her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man’s worried about something, Madge,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worried, not a bit of it, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not in the bachelor nature to worry, provided food
is plentiful and work slack. Pins wouldn’t prick him.
They’re selfish beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you liked the man, Madge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men we flirt with, dear, are not often the men
we marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Dr. Little had descended the stairs, looking
as serious as any middle aged demi-god who had been
snubbed by a school-girl. He crossed the hall to Parker
Steel’s consulting-room, took out a bottle containing
tabloids of perchloride of mercury from the cabinet, dissolved
two in the basin fixed in one corner of the room,
and sedulously and carefully disinfected his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the devil—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This meditative exclamation appeared to limit the gentleman’s
reflections for the moment. He stood with bent
shoulders, staring at his hands soaking in the rose-tinted
water, like some mediæval wiseacre striving to foresee
the future in a pot of ink.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The glitter of the sea visible between the foliage of
flowering-shrubs seemed to add a touch of vivacity
to the June somnolence that hung like a summer mist
over the south-coast town. Parker Steel, half lying in a
basket-chair under a red May-tree in the hotel garden,
betrayed his sympathy with the poetical paraphernalia
of life by reading through a list of investments recommended
by his brokers. A satisfactory breakfast followed
by the contemplation of a satisfactory banking account
begets peace in the heart of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about ten o’clock, and a few enthusiasts were
already quarrelling over croquet, when the hotel “buttons”
came out with a telegram on a tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. 25, Dr. Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any reply, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy waited with the tray held over that portion of
his figure where his morning meal reposed, while Parker
Steel tore open the envelope and read the message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait; tell them at the office to get my bill made up.
I have to leave after lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And bring me a time-table, and a whiskey and soda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel glanced at his watch, thrust the investment
list into the breast-pocket of his coat, and lay back
again in his chair with the telegram across his knee.
Faces vary much in their expression when the mind behind
the face labors with some thought that fills the whole
consciousness for the moment. The smooth indolence
had melted from the physician’s features. His face had
sharpened as faces sharpen in bitter weather, for a man
who is a coward betrays his cowardice even when he
thinks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A much-grieved croquet-player in a blue-and-white
check dress was confiding her criticisms to a very sympathetic
gentleman in one corner of the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is such a pity that Mrs. Sallow cheats so abominably.
I hate playing with mean people. Every other
stroke is a spoon, and she is always walking over her ball,
and shifting it with her skirt when it is wired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People give their characters away in games.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so contemptible. I can’t understand any self-respecting
person cheating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The continuous click of the balls appeared to irritate
Parker Steel, as he sat huddled up in his chair with the
telegram on his knee. He found himself listening—without
curiosity—to the young lady in the blue-and-white
whose complaints suggested that the immoral Mrs. Sallow
was the cleverer player of the two. Dishonesty is
only dishonest, to many people, when it comes within
the cognizance of the law, and how thoroughly symbolical
those four balls were of the opportunities mortals
manipulate in life, Parker Steel might have realized had
not his mind been clogged with other things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy returned with a time-table and the whiskey
and soda on a tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fast train leaves at 2.30, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks; get me a table. You can keep the change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged, sir,” and he touched a carefully watered
forelock; “will you drive, sir, or walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Order me a cab.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the boy noticed, as he turned away, that the hand
shook that reached for the glass, and that some of the
stuff was spilled before it came to the man’s lips.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>No one met Parker Steel at Roxton station that June
evening. A porter piled his luggage on a cab, for the
physician’s own carriage was not forthcoming. A sense
of isolation and neglect took hold upon him as he drove
through the sleepy streets of the old town. Loneliness is
never comforting to a man who is cursed with an irrepressible
conscience, and his own restless imaginings rose
like a cold fog into the June air. Parker Steel shivered
as he had often shivered when driving through moonlit
mists to answer a midnight message. The very elms about
St. Antonia’s spire had a shadowy strangeness for him, a
gloom that gave nothing of the glow of a return home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel stood in his own dining-room, waiting and
listening, as though he were in a stranger’s house. Symons,
the starched servant, had opened the door to him without
a smile; his luggage had been carried up-stairs. He
had heard voices, faint, distant voices, that had tantalized
him with words that he could not understand. He had
been ready to ask the woman Symons a dozen questions,
but had faltered from a self-conscious fear of betraying
his own thoughts. The house seemed full of some indefinable
dread as the dusk deepened towards night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A door opened above. He heard footsteps descending
the stairs, so slowly in the silence of the darkening house,
that the sound reminded the man of the slow drip of
water into a well. Parker Steel found himself counting
them as they descended towards the hall. If it was
Betty, how was he to construe the message of the morning?
The suffering of suspense drove him to action. He
turned sharply, crossed the room, and, opening the door,
looked out into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, dear, is it you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in white, and her foot was on the last step of
the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad that you have come, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had your wire early. I imagined—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I was ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that you were ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She halted with one hand on the carved foot-post of
the balustrading. The dusk of the hall showed nothing
but a white figure and a gray oval to mark her face.
Some mysterious psychic force seemed to hold husband
and wife apart. Their two personalities had become incompatible
through some subtle ferment of distrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a step forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I want you to go into that room and light the
gas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The insistent note in her voice repulsed him. His
walk approached a self-conscious shuffle as he turned
and re-entered the darkening room. Betty heard him
groping for the matches. A sudden glare of light followed
the sharp purr of a flaring match. She drew a deep and
sighing breath, pressed her hands to her breast, and entered
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel was drawing the blinds. His wife closed
the door, and waited for him to turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I had your wire, dear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wondered what I should find—here. The wording—Good
Heavens, Betty—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood back from him and leaned against the sideboard,
the glare from the gas falling full upon her face.
It was red, repulsive, tinged with an ooze that had hardened
here and there into yellow scabs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Parker, why I sent for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked for the moment like a man shocked into
immobility by a sudden storm of wind and sleet beating
on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did this appear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved towards her, the shallow gleam of sympathy
in his eyes darkened by something more terrible than
mere fear. Betty stood her ground. It was the man
who betrayed the incoherency of panic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were fixed upon her face, upon her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I, Parker, who want to know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, of course, dear, I can understand. You
should have sent for me sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Intuition is a gift of the gods to women, a power—almost
unholy in its brilliant reading of the hearts of others.
Betty’s eyes were searching her husband’s face as though
it were some delicately finished miniature in which every
piece of shading had significance. Her breath came and
went more deeply than when life had a normal flow. For
all else she was cold, very quiet, the mistress even of her
own repulsive face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to tell me, Parker—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw the muscles about his mouth quiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen any one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Little, and Dr. Brimley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well? What—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would tell me nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw him breathe out deeply like a man who has seen
a child escape the wheels of a heavy cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They gave me mere phrases, Parker. A woman can
tell when men are hiding the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What had they to hide, dear? Come closer—here—to
the light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must know, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole truth. Listen—I happened to go yesterday
morning into your consulting-room. Dr. Little
had been reading; he had left the book open—at a certain
page. You know, Parker, that many men only read the
big text-books when they are puzzled by a particular
case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel’s face seemed nothing but a gray and frightened
mask to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, you are imagining things—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, tell me the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A form of eczema.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice had the ring of iron in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was not the word I read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, Betty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke the word without flinching, with a distinctness
that had that cold and terrible conciseness that
science loves. Her eyes did not leave her husband’s face.
Even as he answered her, hotly, haltingly, she knew him
to be a liar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible! You are seizing on a mad coincidence,
a mere ridiculous conclusion. I can swear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, swear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That it is nothing, nothing of what you have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes had the furtive fierceness of eyes searching
her soul for unbelief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Betty, wife—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remained unmoved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? You think that I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t touch me. I don’t believe that you have
told me the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not believe—that I—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, God help me, I cannot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her body had hardly changed the pose that it had
taken from the first moment. It was as though it had
stiffened with the slow, pitiless hardening of her heart.
Parker Steel looked at her like the moral coward that he
was, too crushed by his own keen consciousness of shame
to pretend to the courage that he could not boast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, am I—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung aside from him with an indescribable gesture
of passionate repulsion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t. I can’t look at you, or be looked at. Madge
is waiting for me. They will bring you your dinner.
Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have hindered her, but the manhood in him
had neither the power nor the pride. She swept out and
left him. He heard the sound of sobbing as she climbed
the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel stood listening, staring at the door, a man
who could neither think nor act.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On two successive days the society of loafers that
lounged outside the gates of Roxton station for the
ostensible purpose of carrying hand-bags and parcels, had
noticed Major Murray’s red-wheeled dog-cart meet the
afternoon express from town. The society of luggage
loafers boasted a membership of four. It was not an
energetic brotherhood, and had put up a living protest
against the unseemly scurry and bustle of twentieth-century
methods. The society’s loafing ground ran along
the white fence that closed in the “goods” yard, a fence
that carried, from four distinct patches of discoloration,
the marks left by the brothers’ bodies in their postures
of dignified and independent ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the comings and goings of Roxton seemed known
to these four gentlemen, whose eyes were ever on the alert,
though their hands remained in their trousers-pockets.
A fly basking on the sidewalk within six feet would be seen
and dislodged by a brisk discharge of saliva from between
one of the member’s lips. Like Diogenes, they “had
reduced impertinence to a fine art”; and the major portion
of the society’s funds was patriotically disbursed to swell
the state’s revenue on beer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Psst—’Ere ’e is ag’in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’oo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mouth was wiped by the back of a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murray’s man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same un?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yas. Little feller with the twirly mustache. What
d’yer guess ’e be, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as though ’e might have come t’ wind the clocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet! Ter do with the babies, I’ve ’eard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ’ow was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murray’s man, ’e told me, t’other evening. This little
feller be what they call a ‘Lonnan Special.’ Dunno
what edition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three pairs of eyes, one member was absent on duty
at the pub, followed Major Murray’s dog-cart with an
all-engrossing stare as its red wheels whirled by in the
June sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought Steel ’ad the managin’ of all Murray’s
badgers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So ’e ’as. Didn’t yer see ’im come back by the 7.50
t’other day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ the other feller who’s bin wearin’ Steel’s breeches
all the month—went off by the 4.49.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’E did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saucy lookin’ chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me Jim Murchison and blow the liquor. ’E
tells you what’s what, and no mistake. Said I sh’ld drink
meself to death—and so I shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, ’ad the roups again, Frank?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, all along with my old liver. Chucks it out of
me every marnin’, reg’lar as clock-work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The observations of the brotherhood were reliable as
far as the identity of the gentleman in Major Murray’s
dog-cart was concerned. He was named Dr. Peterson,
and his caliber may be appreciated by the fact that he
received a check for twenty-five guineas when he travelled
forty miles to and fro from his house in Mayfair.
Moreover, he had left his card the preceding day on Dr.
Parker Steel, with a note urging that an interview between
them was urgent and inevitable. Parker Steel’s face had
betrayed exceeding discomfort and alarm on reading the
name on the piece of paste-board that Dr. Peterson had
left on the general practitioner’s hall table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about four o’clock on the afternoon of Thursday
when Major Murray’s dog-cart clattered over the
cobbles of St. Antonia’s Square, and deposited a very
spruce little man in a well-cut frock-coat, and a blemishless
tall hat at Parker Steel’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The imperturbable Symons recognized him as the
caller of yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Steel’s out, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very sorry, sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gave him my card and note?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, sir. Will you wait? Dr. Steel should be
back at any minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Peterson glanced at his watch, and stepped like a
dapper little bantam into the hall. His reddish hair was
plastered from a broad pathway in the middle, so as to
conceal the premature tendency to baldness that his pate
betrayed. Dr. Peterson’s figure boasted a juvenile waist;
his face, smooth and very sleek, almost suggested the
craft of the beauty specialist. A red-and-green bandanna
handkerchief protruded from his breast coat-pocket, an
æsthetic patch of color harmonizing with his sage-green
tie. He wore black-and-white check trousers, patent-leather
boots, and a tuberose in his button-hole. Moreover,
his person smelled fragrantly of scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Peterson deposited his hat and gloves on the hall
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can spare half an hour. My train goes at five. It
is highly important that I should see Dr. Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell him, sir, the minute he returns,” and she
showed Dr. Peterson into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bedroom bell rang as Symons was descending the
stairs to the kitchen. She turned with a “Drat the thing!”
and dawdled heavenward to her mistress’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who has called, Symons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Peterson, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Major Murray’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am; wants to see the master, most particular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Steel’s not in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, but he left word that he would be at home
about four.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Symons, you can go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant’s ill-conditioned stare was bitterness to a
woman of Betty’s pride and penetration. The finer
touches of courtesy, the more delicate instincts, are rarely
developed in the lower classes. Even the starched
Symons was utterly cowlike in her manners. Betty felt
her face sore under the servant’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big red book lay open upon the dressing-table amid
Betty Steel’s crowd of silver knick-knacks. It was the
<span class='it'>Medical Directory</span>, and lay open at the London list, and
at the letter P. Dr. Peterson’s name headed the left-hand
page, as staff-physician to sundry hospitals and
charitable institutions, and as a holder of medals, diplomas,
and degrees galore. A cursory glance at the titles
of his contributions to medical literature would have
marked him out as one of the leading authorities on
diseases of the skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel looked in her pier-glass, fluffed out her hair
a little, and fastening the scarf of her green tea-gown,
crossed the landing towards the stairs. She had that
steady and almost staring expression of the eyes that betrays
a purpose suddenly but seriously matured. She
had not spoken with her husband since their meeting on
the night of his return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Peterson, I believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The specialist had been reviewing the photographs on
the mantel-piece, and had displayed his good taste by
electing a handsome cousin of Betty’s as his ideal for the
moment. He set the silver frame down rather hurriedly,
and turned at the sound of the door opening, a dapper,
diplomatic, yet rather finicking figure, the figure more of
a little man about town than of a brilliant and prosperous
London consultant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Steel—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had glanced up with a slight puckering of the brows
into Betty’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I am sorry my husband is out. I have taken
the opportunity, Dr. Peterson, of consulting you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved towards the window, graceful, well poised,
and unembarrassed. The specialist stood aside, his face
a sympathetic blank, a birdlike and inquisitive alertness
visible in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have noticed my face, Dr. Peterson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood before him unflinchingly, a woman of distinction
and of charm of manner despite her great disfigurement.
The fingers of Dr. Peterson’s right hand
were fidgeting with his watch-chain. It was wholly improper
for a London consultant to appear embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wish to consult me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated, elevated his eyebrows, and then met her
with a conciliatory smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, Mrs. Steel, whether—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She understood his meaning and the significance of
his hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband? Yes—Your opinion will be of interest
to him. Let us be frank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Peterson advanced one patent-leather boot, put
the forefinger of his right hand under Betty’s chin, and
turned her face towards the light. She could see that he
was profoundly interested despite his air of shallow
smartness. Also that he was somewhat perplexed by
the responsibility she had thrust upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum! How long have you noticed the swelling on
the lip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five weeks or more, perhaps longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The throat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened her mouth wide. Dr. Peterson peered into
it and frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rash has been present some days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are paler than usual?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feverish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Dr. Steel has seen all this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was embarrassed, troubled, and betrayed the feeling
in an increased fussiness and polite magniloquence of
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must pardon me, Mrs. Steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to be quite frank with me. I am ready
to answer any questions. You may think my attitude
unusual—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all—not at all,” and he flicked his handkerchief
from his pocket and began to polish a lens in a tortoise-shell
setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must confess, Dr. Peterson, that I have been subjected
to a great deal of worry and—and doubt. My
husband only returned yesterday. Of course, you know
about that. Dr. Little sent for you to see Major Murray’s
wife, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Peterson still flourished his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Dr. Steel expressed any opinion to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He told me that it was a form of eczema.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The specialist threw a sharp, penetrating look at her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was your husband’s diagnosis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it to be incorrect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that he knows that he has not told me the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both heard the rattle of a latch-key in the lock of the
front door, and the sound of footsteps in the hall. Symons
could be heard hurrying up the stairs from the kitchen.
She spoke to some one in the hall, a tired and toneless
voice answering her in curt monosyllables. It was Parker
Steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Peterson walked up the room and back again to
the window, glancing rather nervously at the clock as he
passed. His attitude was that of a man who has been
entangled in the meshes of a very delicate dilemma, and
he was waiting to see how Betty Steel’s mood shaped.
She was standing with one hand resting on the back of
a chair, as though steadying herself for the inevitable
crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, good-day; I must apologize—Betty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had entered with an elaborate flourish intended to
suggest the brisk candor of a man much hurried in the
public service. His wife’s figure, outlined against the
window, brought him to a dead halt on the threshold.
The blood seemed to recede from his face in an instant.
The alert, confident manner became a tense effort towards
naturalness and self-control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will excuse us, Betty. Dr. Peterson and I have
matters to discuss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held the door open for her, but she did not budge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am consulting Dr. Peterson, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband’s face seemed to grow thin and haggard,
with the lights and shadows of the hall for a checkered
background. The specialist stood jerking his watch-chain
up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” he began—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty turned to him with the air of a mistress of a salon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a family affair, Dr. Peterson, is it not? There
are no secrets that a husband and wife cannot share. I
may tell my husband what I believe your opinion to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My opinion, madam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice betrayed the rising impatience of a man
irritated by finding his discretion taxed beyond its strength.
The grim touch of the tragic element banished the veneer
of formalism from his face. To pose such a man as Dr.
Peterson with a problem in ethics, engendered anger and
impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not aware that I have pledged myself to any
expression of opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and she smiled; “but I can ask you a blunt
question, to which ‘yes’ or ‘no’ will be inevitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The specialist met her eyes, and realized that the
subtlety of a woman may make a man’s prudence seem
ridiculous. He was a rapid thinker, and the complexities
of the situation began to shape themselves in his mind.
Betty Steel was not a woman whom he would care to
hinder with a lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You put me in a most embarrassing position—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe me, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With regard to another case I have some authority to
speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider my case within your jurisdiction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty:” Her husband’s face was turned to hers in
miserable reproof. “Remember, we are something to
each other. I cannot bear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He faltered as he read the unalterable purpose in her
eyes. It is the nature of some women to appear incapable
of pity when their self-love has received a
poignant shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Parker, you admit—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, Betty, let me have five minutes’
privacy—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him calmly, as though considering his
inmost thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Dr. Peterson can deal with you more forcibly
than I can. It is sufficient that we understand each
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you no consideration for my self-respect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my self-respect that accuses you in this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she turned and left the two men together.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wet evening in June, and a steady downrush
of rain purred on the tiled roofs of the old town and
set the broad eaves and high-peaked gables dripping.
A summer sweetness breathed in the gardens where the
fallen petals of rhododendrons lay like flame upon the
green grass. The roses were weighed down with dew,
and each leaf diamonded with a glimmering tear. In
Lombard Street the tall cypresses stood like solemn monks
cowled and coped against the rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The downpour had lessened a little, and Jack Murchison,
flattening his nose against the nursery window,
saw a country cart driven by a man in a white mackintosh
swing into Lombard Street from the silver, rain-drenched
sheen of St. Antonia’s trees. The man’s big white body
streamed with wet, his face shining out like a drenched
peony under the brim of his hat, that dripped like the
flooded gutter of a house. Tremulous rain-drops fell
rhythmically from the big man’s nose, and the apron that
covered his legs was full of puddles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The country cart drew up outside the doctor’s house,
and Master Jack saw the big man in the white mackintosh
climb out laboriously, the cart tilting under his weight.
He threw the leather apron over the horse’s loins, and
swung the water out of his hat, disclosing to the
boy above a round bald patch about the size of a
saucer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell rang, a good, rattling, honest peal that told
of a straightforward and unaffected fist. Jack heard
Mary’s rather nasal treble answering the big man’s vigorous
bass. The white mackintosh was doffed and hung
considerately on the handle of the bell. There was much
wiping of boots, while the man Gage appeared at the
side gate in the garden wall, and came forward to hold
the farmer’s horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to bother you, doctor, on such a beast of an
evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, Mr. Carrington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember me, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t forget many faces. Come into my study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doffing of the white mackintosh had uncovered a
robust and rather corpulent, thick-set figure in rough
tweed jacket and breeches and box-cloth leggings. The
farmer had one of those typically solid English faces,
fresh-colored though deeply wrinkled, and chastening its
good humor with an alert, world-wise watchfulness in the
rather deep-set eyes. Mr. Carrington was considered
rather a masterful man by his friends, a man who could
laugh while his wits were at work bettering a bargain.
He was one of the most prominent farmers in the neighborhood,
and one of the few who confessed to making
money despite the times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My trap’s waiting outside, doctor. I want you to come
back with me right away to Goldspur Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington was sitting on the extreme edge of a
chair, and wiping the rain from his face with a silk handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything much the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doctor, you know I have taken to growing a
lot of ground-fruit, and I’ve had about fifty pickers down
from town this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re camped out in two tin shanties and a couple
of tents down at Goldspur Farm. East-enders, all of
them; and you never quite know, doctor, what an East-ender
carries. Well, to be frank, I’m worried about
some of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington sat squarely in his chair, and tapped
the floor with the soles of his boots. He looked thoughtful,
and the corners of his big, good-tempered mouth had
a melancholy droop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one woman in particular, doctor, and her
youngster, who seem bad. Sick and sweating; won’t
take food; they just lie there in the straw like logs. My
foreman didn’t tell me anything about it till this afternoon,
but when I’d seen the woman I had the horse put
in, and came straight here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison glanced at his watch, and then crossed the
room and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you have me driven back?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Ah, Mary, will you ask your mistress to
have dinner postponed till eight. And tell Gage to take
these letters to the post. Now, Mr. Carrington, my
mackintosh and I are at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll need it, doctor, and an old hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slender vein of gold gashed the dull west as they
left the outskirts of the town behind. As the rent in the
sky broadened, long rays of light came down the valley,
making the woods and meadows a glory of shimmering
green, and firing the rain pools so that they shone like
brass. The farmer took the private road that ran through
Ulverstone Park, a rolling wilderness of beeches and
Scotch firs, whose green “rides” plunged into the glimmering
rain-splashed umbrage of tall trees. Here were
tangled banks of purpling heather, and great stretches
of sweet woodland turf. Old yews brooded in the deeps of
the domain, solemn and still, most ancient and wise of trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, Molly,” and Mr. Carrington shook a raindrop
from his nose, and flicked the brown mare with the
whip. “Clearing a little. Sorry for the people who cut
their hay yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somewhat damp. How is the fruit doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pretty fair, pretty fair, as far as our strawberries
are concerned. The finest year, doctor, is when you
have a first-class crop and your neighbors can only put
up rubbish. It’s no good every one being in tip-top form.
I’ve got rid of tons, and at no dirt price, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington’s British face beamed slyly above his
angelic white mackintosh. It was a face in which stolid
satisfaction and stolid woe were easily interchanged, for
the heavy lines thereof could be twisted into either expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison was listening to the hoarse rattle of the
clearing shower beating upon a myriad leaves. The gold
band in the west was broadening into a canopy of splendor.
Had Mr. Carrington been educated up to more
pushing and aggressive methods of making money, he
would have seen in that sky nothing but a magnificent
background for some silhouetted sky-sign shouting “Try
Our Jam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And these pickers of yours, how long have they been
with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines in the farmer’s face rearranged themselves
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor devils, they look on this as a sort of yearly picnic,
doctor. There are about fifty of them, and they’ve
been at Goldspur about ten days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Children? Plenty. If they were Irish, they’d bring
the family pig out, doctor, just to give him some new sort
of dirt to wallow in. But then, what can you expect—what
can you expect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left the park by the western lodge, and came
out upon a stretch of undulating fields closed in the near
distance by woods of oak and beech. A tall, gabled farm-house
of red brick rose outlined against the sky with a
great fir topping its chimney-stacks like the flat cloud
seen above a volcano in full eruption. Near it, fronting
the road, were a few nondescript cottages; farther still a
jumble of barns, outhouses, and stables. In the middle
of a fourteen-acre field Murchison could see two zinc-roofed
sheds and a couple of old military tents standing
isolated in a waste of sodden, dreary soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington pointed to them with his whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the colony. Will you come in first, doctor,
and have—” he reconsidered the words and cleared his
throat—“and have—a cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison had noticed the break in the invitation, and
had reddened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks. We had better walk, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit light, doctor; we have a sort of road, though it
ain’t exactly Roman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer passed Murchison the reins, and climbed
down, the trap swaying like a small boat anchored in a
swell. He opened a gate leading into the field, his white
mackintosh flapping about his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not worth while getting up again,” he said, laconically.
“Drive her on, doctor, I’ll follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison heard the click of the gate, and the squelch
of Mr. Carrington’s boots in the mud, as the trap
bumped at a walking pace towards the zinc sheds in the
field. The larger of the two resembled a coach-house,
and could be closed at one end by two swinging doors.
The rain was still rattling on the roof as Murchison
drove up, and a thin swirl of smoke drifted out sluggishly
from the darkness of the interior. The two tents had a
soaked and slatternly appearance. Empty bottles, old
tins, scraps of dirty paper, and miscellaneous rubbish
littered the ground. On a line slung between two chestnut
poles three dirty towels were hanging, either to wash
or to dry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the trap stopped at the end of the rough road, Murchison
could see that the larger shed was like a big hutch
full of live things crowded together. A litter of straw,
ankle deep, lay round the walls. A fire burned in the
middle of the earth floor. The faces that were lit up by
the light from the fire were coarse, quick-eyed, and
hungry, the faces seen in London slums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a dozen children scuttled out like a litter of young
pigs, and stood in the slush and rain, staring at the trap.
Murchison’s appearance on the scene seemed to arouse
no stir of interest among the adult dwellers in the shed.
They stared, that was all, one or two breaking the silence
with crude and characteristic brevity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Ello, ’ere’s the b——y doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s ’air!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at the hold boss, with a phiz like a round o’ raw
beef stuck hon top of a sack of flour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington arrived with his boots muddy and the
lines of his face emphatic and authoritative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one hold the mare. Why don’t you keep the
kids in out of the wet? This way, doctor, the second
tent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington opened the flap, and, letting Murchison
enter, contented himself with staring hard at two figures
lying on an old flock mattress with a coat rolled up for a
pillow. One was a woman, thin, still pretty, in a hollow-cheeked,
hectic way, with a ragged blouse open at the
throat, and a couple of sacks covering her. The other
was a child, a girl with flaxen hair tossed about a flushed
and feverish face. The child seemed asleep, with half
an orange, sucked to the pulp, clutched by her grimy
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murchison remained for perhaps half an hour in that
rain-soaked tent, while Mr. Carrington stumped up and
down impatiently, kicking the mud from his boots and
eying the rubbish that marked the presence of these
London poor. The eastern sky was filling fast with the
oblivion of night when Murchison emerged. The woman
had been able to answer his questions in a dazed and
apathetic way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington met him with a squaring of his sturdy
shoulders and a bluff uplift of the chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you sent for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As bad as that, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Typhoid, or I am much mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer thrust his hands into the side pockets of
his mackintosh, and flapped them to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m damned!” was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold sky rose dusted with a few stars in the west
when the farmer’s cart set Murchison down in Lombard
Street before his own door. Dinner had been waiting
more than an hour. Catherine’s face, bright, yet a little
troubled, met him in the shaded glow of the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be soaked to the skin, dear,” and she felt
his clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, nothing much. I’m more hungry than wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A long case. Dinner is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went into the dining-room together, Murchison’s
arm about her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some responsibility for me at last,” he said, quietly;
“I believe it is typhoid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where, at Goldspur Farm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, among Carrington’s pickers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are cooped up like cattle in a shed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent for some minutes, for Mary had set a
plateful of hot soup before him, and even doctors are
sufficiently human to enjoy food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a child ill,” he said, staring at the bowl of
roses in the middle of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange, Kate, but she reminds me—wonderfully,
very wonderfully—of Gwen.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the second morning following his interview
with Dr. Peterson that Parker Steel received two letters,
heralding the shadow of an approaching storm.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I have laid the facts of the case,” wrote the demi-god
from Mayfair, “before the General Medical Council.
I consider this action of mine to partake of the
nature of a public duty; for your abuse of your position
has been too gross even for medical etiquette to cover. I
cannot understand how a practitioner of your reputation
could be so mad as to run so scandalous a risk. That
you contracted the disease innocently in the pursuit of
duty would have won you the sympathy of your fellow-practitioners.
Your concealment of the disease puts an
immoral complexion on the case.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Needless to say,
I have given Major Murray the full benefit of an honest
opinion.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such a letter from a physician of Dr. Peterson’s standing
would have been sufficient in itself to demoralize a
man of more courage and tenacity than Parker Steel.
The curt declaration of war that reached him from Major
Murray, by the very same post, exaggerated the effect
that the specialist’s letter had produced.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I have received from Dr. Peterson a statement
that convicts you of the most scandalous mal praxis.
Needless to say, I am placing the matter in the hands of
my solicitor; I consider it to be a case deserving of
publicity, however repugnant the atmosphere surrounding
the affair may be to me and mine.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Murray.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Those who have touched the realities of war will tell
you that they have seen men with faces pinched as by a
frost, their teeth chattering like castanets, even under the
blaze of an African sun. It was at the breakfast-table
that Parker Steel read those two ominous letters. The
man looked ill and yellow, and his nerves were none too
steady, to judge by the way he had gashed himself in
shaving. The very clothes he wore seemed to have
grown creased and shabby in a week, as though they felt
the wearer’s figure limp and shrunken, and had lost tone
in consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be remembered that the Immortal Three displayed
varying symptoms when at grips with death. The
tongue of Ortheris waxed feverishly profane; the Yorkshireman
broke out into song; Mulvaney, the Paddy, was
incontinently sick. Parker Steel emulated the Irishman
in this eccentricity that morning, save that his nausea
was inspired by panic, and not by heroic rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shaken and very miserable, he sat down at the bureau
in his consulting-room, leaned his head upon his hands,
and shivered. For two nights he had had but short
snatches of sleep, brief lapses into oblivion that had been
rendered vain by dreams. The imminent dread of a
hundred ignominies had held him sick and cold through
the short darkness of the summer nights. Dawn had
come and found him feverish and very weary. To a
coward it is torture to be alone with his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third night he had taken sulphonal, a full dose,
and had slept till Symons knocked at his bedroom door.
The fog of the drug still clung about his brain as he sat
at the bureau and tried to think. He seemed incapable
of putting any purpose into motion, like an exhausted
battery whose cells have been drained of their electric
charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel picked up a pen after he had crouched
there silently for some twenty minutes. He opened a
drawer, drew out several sheets of note-paper, and began to
scribble confused, jerky sentences, to alter, to reconsider,
and to erase. The power to determine and to act, even
on paper, were lost to him that morning. He wrote two
letters, only to tear them up and scatter the pieces in the
grate, where a lighted match set them burning. He was
still on his knees, turning over the charred fragments,
when the door-bell rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sedate Symons came to announce a patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Prosser, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I can’t see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Symons stared. Her master had something of the air
of an angry dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I’m busy. She can call again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She still stood in the doorway, irresolute, surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil are you waiting there for, Symons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she withdrew, with her dignity balanced on the
tip of a very much tilted nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel opened the window wide, and leaning his
hands on the sill, looked out into the garden. It was air
that he needed—air amid the stifling complexities of life
that were crowding tumultuous upon his future. The
garden with the sumptuous serenity of its trees and flowers
had no sympathetic touch for him in his agony of
isolation. It was his loneliness that weighed upon him
heavily at that moment. He had outlawed himself, as
it were, from the heart of his own wife. The very house
was a pest-house in which two stricken souls were sundered
and held apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Betty would only see him. If she could only bring
herself to understand that he had acted this disastrous
part in order to retain the social satisfactions that she
loved. Any companionship, even the companionship of
a half-estranged wife, seemed preferable to the isolation
that he felt deepening about him. He argued that it was
his realization of Betty’s ambition that had made him
dissemble for her sake. Any argument, however suspicious,
is pressed into the service of a man whose whole
desire is to justify himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, when a woman’s trust has been once
shocked from its foundations, no buttressing and underpinning
can save that superstructure of sentiment that
has taken years to build. Betty had kept to her room
with no one but Madge Ellison to give her sympathy and
advice. The husband had always found the friend embarrassing
with her presence any <span class='it'>rapprochement</span> between
him and his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he stood at the open window, with the words of the
two letters he had read weaving a hopeless tangle of bewilderment
in his brain, he heard some one descend the
stairs and go out by the front door into the square. Parker
Steel realized that this ubiquitous and embarrassing
friend had left Betty alone in the room above. There
was some chance at last of his seeing her alone, and of
attempting to break down the barrier of her reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He climbed the stairs slowly, and stood listening for
several seconds on the landing before turning the handle
of his wife’s door. The door was locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker Steel frowned over the ineptitude of the manœuvre.
A dramatic entry might at least have given some
dignity to the trick. As it was, he felt like a sneaking
boy who had been balked and taken in some none too
honorable artifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in a chair near the window, reading, with her
dark hair spread upon her shoulders. Her mouth hardened
as she recognized her husband’s voice. It was the
very day, and she remembered it, the day of Lady Sophia’s
fashionable bazaar when Betty Steel had foreseen the
people of Roxton at her feet. She had asked Madge
Ellison to bring out the dress that she should have worn.
Primrose and leaf-green, it hung across the foot-rail of
her bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to speak to you, Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything that we can discuss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The level tenor of her voice, its unflurried callousness,
gave him an impression of obstinate estrangement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me in. If you will only give me a chance to
justify myself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very words he chose were the words least calculated
to move a woman. Betty, lying back in her chair,
pictured to herself a cringing, deprecating figure that could
boast none of the passionate forcefulness of manhood.
A woman may be won by courage and strength, even in
the person of the man who has done her wrong; but let
her have the repulsion of contempt, and her instinct towards
forgiveness will be frozen into an unbending pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not wish you to make excuses, Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Betty—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was for the sake of the home, the practice, everything.
Can’t you understand? Can’t you imagine what
I have gone through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her momentary silence seemed to suggest a sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you would justify a lie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, don’t talk like this. I am worried to death
by other matters as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can understand that perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to pace the landing, halting irresolutely from
time to time before the locked door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard from Peterson this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is reporting the matter to the General Council,
and he has given the truth away to Murray. You know
what that must mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he been able to see the cynical smile upon her
face, Parker Steel might have understood that by acting
the suppliant for her pity he only intensified her contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, is this fair to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook the door with a sudden gust of petulant impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show me some little consideration. I have some right
to demand—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Demand what you please, Parker, but oblige me by
not making so much noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will regret this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was harsh now and beyond control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have regretted much already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your marriage, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need, Parker, to indulge in details.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is beyond my patience!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, and retreated from the attack at the same
moment that Madge Ellison reappeared upon the stairs.
They passed each other without a word; the woman,
clear-eyed and uncompromising; the man gliding close
to the wall. Madge Ellison found Betty sitting with
closed eyes before the open window, the June sunshine
dappling the bosoms of the tall trees in the square with
gold.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XL</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The month was August, and August at its worst, a
month of glare and dust, and an atmosphere more
trying to the temper than all the insolent bluster of a
bragging March.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington, in his shirt sleeves, and white linen sun-hat
crammed down over his eyes, stood under the acacia-tree
at his garden gate, chatting to the Reverend Peter
Burt, Curate of Cossington, who had tramped three miles
to visit some of the sick people on the farm. Mr. Burt
was rather a shy little man, very much in earnest, and
very much convinced of the responsibility of his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this must have been a great worry to you,” said
the clergyman, with a comprehensive sweep of an oak
stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worry—don’t talk of it, sir. What with the heat, and
the Medical Officer of Health, and the Sanitary Inspector,
I’ve been pretty near crazy. I don’t know what I should
have done, Mr. Burt, but for Murchison and his good
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Murchison seems to have been a local Florence
Nightingale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t happen to know the woman’s name,” he said;
“but she must have been a good ’un, Mr. Burt, to be
showed in the same class as the doctor’s lady. Why—”
and the farmer withdrew his hands from his pockets
and tapped his left palm with his right forefinger—“why,
d’you know what she did when she’d been over here and
seen how we were fixed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington paused expressively, and looked the
young clergyman in the face, as though defying him to
conceive the nature of this unique woman’s genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have not heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Burt, there’s religion and there’s religion;
some of us wear black coats on a Sunday and put silver
in the plate; some of us aren’t so regular and respectable,
but we play the game, and that’s more than many of your
sitting pew-hens do. Excuse me, sir, I’m rather rough
in the tongue. Well, Mrs. Murchison, she doesn’t strike
you as a district visiting sort of lady to look at; she’s got a
fine face and a head of hair, like the Countess of Camber,
who gave the prizes away at our Agricultural Show last
season. Well, Mr. Burt, she came over here, and saw
what sort of a fix we were in, two grumbling nurses, and
not much more than straw and sacking. Well, what does
she do but take one of my wagons and my men and go
off to Roxton all on her own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington paused for breath, took off his sun-hat
and wiped his forehead with it, his eyes remaining fixed
emphatically on the Curate’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what d’you think, sir? Back came that wagon
of mine loaded up with linen, and basins, and crockery,
a bed or two, and God knows what. She’d ransacked her
own house, sir, and gone round to all the neighbors begging
like a papist. Get the stuff? She did that. Not
easy to say no to a woman with a face and a voice like hers.
Carmagee joined in, and Canon Stensly, and a good
score more. And dang my soul, Mr. Burt, she’d been
working with her husband here, day in, day out; and
that’s the sort of thing, sir, that I call religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Curate began to look vaguely uncomfortable under
the farmer’s concentrated methods of address. It took
much to move Mr. Carrington to words, but when once
moved, the result resembled the eruption of a long quiescent
volcano, the vigor of the eruption corresponding
roughly to the length of the period of quiescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite agree with you, Mr. Carrington,” he said,
with a certain boyish stiffness, as though he considered
it superfluous for the farmer to condemn his soul to perdition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must excuse my language, Mr. Burt; when I get
worked up over a subject I must let fly. And it’s these
dirty lies that have been flying abroad about this good
lady’s husband that have made me hot, sir, to see justice
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burt appeared interested by the windows of the
house that glimmered from amid a mass of creepers like
water shining through the foliage of trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hears very curious rumors,” he acknowledged,
with a discreet frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’ve heard them over at Cossington?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have heard reports.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About our doctor here and the drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burt nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t think anyone believed them,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer’s right forefinger began to tap his left palm
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, sir, I ought to know something about Dr.
Murchison’s character, I imagine. The man’s been here
nearly a month, living in my house, and working like a
Trojan. We’ve had nearly sixty cases, what with the
pickers and our own people. You haven’t seen what
the doctor’s been through in this little epidemic of ours,
Mr. Burt, and I have. You get to the bottom of a man’s
nature when he’s working eighteen hours out of the
twenty-four, doing the nurse’s jobs as well as his own,
and feeding some of the kids with his own hands. I’ve
seen him come into my parlor, sir, at night, and go slap
off to sleep on the sofa, he was that done. And never,
not on one single blessed occasion, have I seen that man
show the white feather or touch a drop of drink!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burt appeared to become more and more embarrassed
by being stared at vehemently in the face, as the
farmer’s right fist smacked the points of his argument
into his left palm. He had to return Mr. Carrington’s
stare, eye to eye, as a pledge of sincerity. He began to
fidget, to scan the horizon, and to fumble with his watch-chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your evidence sounds conclusive,” he said; “I think
it is time I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington ignored the little man’s restiveness, and
came and stood outside the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I make it a rule in life, Mr. Burt, to take people
just as I find ’em, and not to listen to what all the old
women say. The rule of a practical man, you understand.
Now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Curate cast a flurried glance up the road, and pulled
out his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must really excuse me, Mr. Carrington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a hurry, are you? Well, I was only going to say
that some of us people have come by a shrewd notion
how all this chaff got chucked about in these parts. Murchison
was a first-class man, and some people got jealous
of him, and played a low-down game to get him out of
the town. You take my meaning, Mr. Burt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, certainly. Good Heavens, it is nearly twelve.
I must really say good-bye, Mr. Carrington; I hope—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, sir. I won’t mention any name, but
perhaps you are just as wise as I am. And what’s more,
Mr. Burt, from what I’ve heard, that gentleman that we
know of has just been treated as he tried to treat a better
man than himself. It was his wife, they say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, Mr. Carrington, but some one is calling
you, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can wait. Now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be frank with you, Mr. Carrington, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, sir, if you are in such a hurry, I’ll postpone
my remarks. I was only going to say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Burt gave him a wave of the hand, and fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl of seventeen came down the path from the house,
between the standard roses, her black hair already gathered
up tentatively at the back of a brown neck, and the
smartness of her blouse and collar betraying the fact that
she considered herself a mature and very eligible woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad, are you deaf?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington turned with the leisurely composure of
a father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this noise about, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been calling you for five minutes. They’re all
there—in the fourteen-acre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mrs. Murchison and the Canon, and old Lady
Gillingham, and half a dozen more. Dr. Murchison sent
one of the boys over for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington began to hustle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dang it, I expected them to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a man you are, dad!” and she stood like an
armed angel of scorn in the middle of the path; “you
can’t go and see them in your shirt-sleeves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul, Nan, where’s my coat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the fence. You were talking to Mr. Burt long
enough to forget it. Why didn’t you bring him in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington was struggling into his alpaca coat,
his daughter watching his contortions with the superior
serenity of seventeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring who in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Burt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little man’s as shy as a calf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you talked him silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, my dear, it’s too hot to argue. Is my tie
proper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His daughter regarded him with critical candor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will do,” she answered, resignedly, as though her
father’s ties were beyond all promise of salvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The camp of the fruit-pickers in Mr. Carrington’s
fourteen-acre stood out like a field-hospital under the
August sun. There were half a dozen white tents pitched
near the two sheds, and on an ingenious frame-work of
poles an awning had been spread so that convalescents
could be brought out to lie in the shade, and gain the
maximum amount of air. The whole place looked trim
and clean, and a faint perfume of some coal-tar disinfectant
permeated the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington, as he emerged from the orchard gate,
saw quite a representative gathering moving through the
camp. Several of the Roxton celebrities who had subscribed
to the relief fund, had been invited by Porteus
Carmagee, the treasurer, to drive over and see how the
money had been spent. The farmer recognized Lady
Gillingham’s carriage and pair waiting in the roadway
beyond the white field-gate. The Canon’s landau had
drawn up deferentially behind it, while Mrs. Murchison’s
pony, that drew her governess car, was being held by one
of the pickers who had lost two children but a week
ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Sophia appeared to be holding quite a state inspection,
for she had Murchison in his white linen jacket
at one elbow, and the Canon in his black coat at the other.
She was making considerable use of her lorgnette—a very
affable, commonplace, and well-meaning great lady, who
felt it to be a most Christian condescension on her part
to drive out and examine this temporary hospital and its
London poor. Catherine Murchison and Mrs. Stensly
were talking to one of the women lying under the awning.
The treasurer had remained judiciously in the background,
and was snapping away to three Roxton ladies
who appeared to be fascinated by some subject foreign
to enteric fever and pickers of fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Porteus Carmagee looked very much amused. A thin
little lady in a hat far too big for her, giving her an indistinct
resemblance to a mushroom, was attempting to draw
more definite information from the lawyer by the feminine
pretence of unbelief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are you sure, Mr. Carmagee? It may only be a
rumor; one hears so many extraordinary things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perfectly sure, madam. There are facts, however,
that cannot well be discussed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestion of mystery lent a double glamour to
Porteus Carmagee’s information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he has left the town for good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I may swear to that as a fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely his wife—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carmagee tightened up his mouth and stared reflectively
into space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask me to unravel the complexities of other
people’s households, Mrs. Blount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how extraordinary! Of course everyone knows
that she is ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one knows a great deal more of one’s private
affairs, madam, than one knows one’s self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three ladies exchanged glances; they formed
three spokes of curiosity, with Mr. Carmagee for the
hub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no one has seen Betty Steel for some weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is rumored—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you have heard that too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That it is an affection of the skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer extricated himself from the group, and
moved to where Catherine’s golden head shone Madonna-like
over the face of a little child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Affection of tom-cats,” quoth he, under his breath;
“it is curious the way these women play with a piece of
scandal like a cat with a mouse. It mustn’t die, or half
the zest of the game would be gone. Catherine, my
friend, you are different from the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these digressions Mr. Carrington had brought
himself within the ken of Lady Gillingham’s lorgnette.
It appeared to the farmer that the great lady’s eyes were
fixed critically upon his tie. His right shoulder blushed
as he remembered that there was a three-inch rent there
in the seam of his alpaca coat. Such is the judgment
that overtakes those who are mistaken as to
dates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning, Mr.—Mr. Carrington. We are admiring
how beautifully you have managed everything for
these poor people. So clean, and so—so airy. I am sure
you must have suffered a great deal of inconvenience and
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carrington blushed. Porteus Carmagee, who
was watching the drama from a distance, felt for Mr.
Carrington a species of ironical pity. The farmer’s boots
described an angle of ninety degrees with one another,
and the vehement smirk upon his face made the redness
thereof seem dangerously sultry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have all been so interested, Mr. Carrington—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good of your ladyship, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent you an iron bedstead, you may remember. I
hope it has been of use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great use, your ladyship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that is right; and is your family quite well, Mr.
Carrington? I hope none of you have contracted the
disease?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only my youngest boy, your ladyship, but Dr. Murchison
soon had him in hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, quite so; good-day, Mr. Carrington,” and she
relieved him from the splendor of her notice, and turned
to Murchison, who was waiting at her elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a noble profession, the physician’s, Dr. Murchison!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big, brown-faced man smiled, and his eyes wandered
unconsciously in the direction of his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has its responsibilities,” he said, “and also its compensations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Sophia waved her lorgnette to and fro, and beamed
to the extent of the five-guinea check she had contributed
to the relief fund. She was wondering whether it was
possible that this quiet, clear-eyed man could ever have
been the victim of such a thing as drink. If so—then he
was to be pitied, and not abused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be so gratifying, Dr. Murchison, to save the
life of a fellow-being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is something to be grateful for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How well your wife looks! I hear she has been working
here, like any trained nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catherine, dancing a doll before the thin little hands
of a child of four, was serenely oblivious of the great
lady’s praise. Porteus Carmagee was watching her,
smiling, and rattling his keys in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wife is very fond of children, Dr. Murchison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked into the distance, and then at the laughing
girl of four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She lost a child, and that means much to a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, of course, undoubtedly. Poor little creature!”
and her ladyship tended benignly in the direction of the
awning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Stensly and Murchison were left alone together
by one of the tents. A man was delirious within
it, and they could hear the meaningless patter of fever
flowing in one monotonous tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A doctor’s life is no sinecure,” and he stroked his firm
round chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, perhaps no. We walk daily at the edge of a
precipice. And yet it has great compensations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent a moment, watching Lady Sophia trying
to coquet with a rather overpowered child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard about Steel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my wife told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of those strange fatalities we meet with in life.
And yet I think there was something of the nature of a
judgment in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly. I am sorry for the woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are magnanimous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have learned the true values of life. When one
has suffered—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One loses the meaner impulses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And remains thankful for what one has?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what one has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Murchison’s eyes were smiling towards his wife.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel sat alone at the open window of her
room one evening as the sun went down over the
red roofs of the old town. Lying back in her chair, with
her head on a cushion of yellow silk, she could see nothing
of the life in the square below, but only the tops of
the elm-trees, the black spire of the church, and an infinite
expanse of cloud-barred sky. The west stood one
great splendor of scarlet and of gold. Above, at the
zenith, the clouds were bathed in a radiance of auriferous
rose. A cold chalcedony blue held the eastern arch,
where the purple rim of the night merged into the amethystine
shadows of the woodland hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel was alone, save for the cat Mignon, curled
up asleep in her mistress’s lap. Half covering the cat
was a crumpled letter, a letter that had been read and
reread by eyes that were blind to the pageant of the summer
sky. She stirred now and again in her chair, and
shivered. The evening seemed cold to her despite all
this chaos of color, this kindling of the torches of the
west. The house, too, had an empty silence, like a
lonely house where death had been and set a seal upon
its lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty lifted Mignon from her lap, rose, crossed the
room, and rang the bell. She took a crimson opera-cloak
from a wardrobe in the corner, flung it across her shoulders,
and returned to her chair, with the crumpled letter
still in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A white cap and apron were framed by the shadows
of the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Miss Ellison back yet, Symons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am. She said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen! Isn’t that the front door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you ask her to come to me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white cap and apron vanished into the shadows.
Betty, lying back in her chair, looked vacantly at the
paling sky, with the blood-red cloak deepening the darkness
of her hair. The cat Mignon sprang into her lap.
Dreamily, and as by habit, she began to stroke the cat,
while listening to the murmur of the two voices in the
hall below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brisk footsteps ascended the stairs, with the swish of
silk, and the soft sighing of a woman’s breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, dear, at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the door, Madge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I missed my train. You must have wondered what
had happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have ceased to wonder at anything in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison looked curiously at Betty lying back in
her chair, and crossed the room slowly, unbuttoning her
gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sound rather down, dear. What’s that? Have
you heard—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Steel’s hand closed spasmodically upon the
crumpled letter that she held. Her face was hard and
reflective in its outlines. And yet in the eyes there was
a pathos of unrest, the unrest of a woman whose gods
have left her utterly alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard from Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison threw her gloves on the bed, unpinned
her hat, and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is leaving England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leaving England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for the Cape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own mistress to do everything—anything that I
please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a curious little laugh, and began straightening
out the letter on her knee, looking at it with eyes that
strove to make cynicism cover the wounded instincts of
her womanhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—he does not care. He was afraid to face
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coward!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison bent over her, and laid one hand along
her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he has left you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he thought there was nothing else to do.
He says—” and she still smoothed the creased letter under
her hand—“you have your own money to live on. The
practice is worth nothing under the circumstances. I
should advise you to let the house. You cannot afford
to live in it on two hundred pounds a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father left it me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wise father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought, Madge, I should value two hundred
pounds so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mignon, who still possessed some of the kittenish spirit
of her youth, rolled over in Betty’s lap, and began to
clutch at the letter with her paws. There was something
pathetic in the way the wife suffered that scrap of paper
to be a plaything for her pet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he says nothing, dear—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About your joining him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty’s lips curled into a cynical smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, surely—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was I who broke the ties between us. I think I
hated him. He had so little—so little manliness and
strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison lifted up her face to the fading sky.
She was serious for one occasion in her life, a woman
touched by the realism of life’s tragedies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you never—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask me that, Madge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be well, soon, your old self. It is only temporary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it were only skin deep; but it is deeper, deep to the
heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The confidante gave a sad shrug of her shapely shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that yet,” she said; “you might repent
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sky had darkened; the clouds had cast their cloaks
of fire, and in the west one broad band of crimson and of
gold held back the banners of the approaching night.
From St. Antonia’s steeple came the chiming of the hour,
slow, solemn tones that filled the silence with mysterious
eddies of lingering sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison was still leaning over Betty’s chair, her
hands touching her friend’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try not to brood too much on it, dear. I know I am
not much of a woman to give advice. You might say
that I had no experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I too much! Listen,” and she straightened in
her chair, “can’t you hear people shouting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shouting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; as though there were a fire. It seems to come
from Castle Gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both silent, listening, and leaning towards
the open window. Vague, scattered cries rose from the
shadowiness of the darkening town. They seemed to
be drawing from Castle Gate towards the square, a low
flux of sound that rose and fell like the cadence of the
sea upon a shore at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty sank back in her chair with a glimmer of impatience
on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—I remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From under the arch of the old gate-house a crowd
of small boys came scattering into the far corner of the
square. A number of men followed, lined along a couple
of stout ropes. They were dragging a carriage over the
gray cobbles and under the dark elms in the direction
of Lombard Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madge Ellison drew back from the window. Not so
Betty. She rose from her chair, and stood looking down
upon those rough men of the Roxton lanes who were
shouting and waving caps with the unsophisticated and
exhilarating zest of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage with its plebeian team passed under Betty’s
window. In it were a man and a woman, the woman
holding a boy upon her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether some subtle thought-wave passed between
those two or not, it happened that Catherine looked
up and saw the face at the open window overhead. It
seemed to her in the hurly-burly of this little triumph,
that the face above looked down at her out of
a gloom of loneliness and humiliation. A sudden cry
of womanly pity sounded in her heart. Catherine’s

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
